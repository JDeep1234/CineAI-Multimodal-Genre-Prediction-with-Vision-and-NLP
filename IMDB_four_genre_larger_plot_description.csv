Now Elle can finally decide what to do with her future. Unluckily enough, Elle got accepted into two schools: Harvard and Berkeley. While Noah got into Harvard and Lee into Berkeley, she has to lie to them saying that she's got wait-listed to not crush their feelings. They have unforgettable adventures such as camping, fishing, watching a shooting star, going to an aquarium, and watching the sunset. Although, Lee and Elle have a rule saying that ""they must always go to the same school as their bestie"", she decides to think about it later. They leave for San Francisco embarking amazing adventures together.

Unfortunately, their road trip comes to an end and Elle got a job as a waiter to get money for college, despite not knowing which one she'll go to. A few days later, Noah and Elle are at the Flynns' summer house and Noah asks an unexpected question about Harvard. He suggested if Elle gets off the wait list, they could go off campus and get an apartment together. Eventually, Lee ends up jumping off a balcony and drenching Noah and Elle with water. Then, Rachel comes and hands them some drinks. Elle is still ignoring both schools to buy some time. Noah and Elle leave and Lee and Rachel talk about their college plans.

Later that day, they have lunch with Mr and Mrs. Flynn. Lee mentions that they should go to their beach house but they sadly announce that they're planning to sell it. During this, Elle gets a call from the Berkeley administration. They want Elle's answer if she's would want to apply and she asks for a small extension but they give her until the next day to decide. Now, Elle needs to decide, whether she goes with Noah to Harvard or to Berkeley with Lee.

Now, Elle's family is playing UNO and her little Brad (Carson White) wins and dances in triumph. Her father (Stephen Jennings) mentions that he is going on a date with a lady called Linda (Bianca Amato). Elle doesn't seem very thrilled about it and ignores the whole situation.

It's the next day and Elle, Lee, Noah, and Rachel head down to the beach house to help the Flynns to sell it. They have a moment to remember what the beach house meant to them, and how much crazy adventures they had. During this, Rachel and Lee are in a room and Rachel accidentally removes the doorknob. Lee remembers when Elle and Lee were smaller, they used to pretend it was a diamond. Then, Lee takes Rachel's hand and puts the doorknob on her finger. They share a moment and join Elle and Noah looking at a photo of them when they were kids.

Elle and Lee are asked to start cleaning their playroom and they make two piles of the stuff they want to keep and the stuff they donate. They play with some of the stuff and most of the stuff goes to the things they want to keep. Then, Elle remembers that they had a beach bucket list of all the things they wanted to do before going to college.

We meet them and Mr and Mrs. Flynn on the balcony, discussing how it would take 2-3 months to get the house officially sold and Elle and Lee have a plan to persuade them. They ask Mr and Mrs. Flynn if they could stay at the beach house as it would be a real hassle for them to clean, take care of, and put together. The Flynns' parents are convinced and Elle gets a reminder about Berkeley and if she should apply or not. She calls to let them know that she turn the offer down. Then, she talks to Noah and said she going to Harvard. Noah gets excited and Lee immediately understood what had happened. Lee runs away to their playroom to put all the toys away and they have an argument about them going to different schools and how it would affect their friendship. She promises Lee that where ever they are they will stay and remain friends. Then, Elle comes up with this idea that could make their summer the best summer they'll ever have. They're going to complete the bucket list.

Elle goes back home and tells her father about staying at the beach house the whole summer. Her father agrees and Elle, Lee, Rachel, and Noah get settled in the beach house. Noah announces that he had invited some people to celebrate the last and best summer at the beach house. A lot of friends join such as the OMG girls (Bianco Bosch, Camilla Wolfson and Zandile Madliwa), Tuppen (Joshua Daniel Eady), and Ashton (Cameron Scott). Ashton had just finished his first year at Berkeley and Lee and Ashton get along very well which makes Elle very worried.

It's the next day and Elle wakes Lee up with an air horn. Elle shows Lee the bucket list she had made on her computer and they start away start doing the stuff on the bucket list.

Elle is now at work and Lee joins her. Her boss May (Daneel van der Walt) asks Elle if she could do extra shifts and Elle she doesn't feel comfortable with that but still agrees. Elle goes to a table and finds Marco (Taylor Zakhar Perez) with his family.

Back at the beach house, Chloe (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) calls Noah mentioning her family going to be in LA and Noah invites her to stay at the beach house.

Elle and Noah go out for a walk on the beach at night and Noah tells Elle that Chloe was going to be around and invited her to stay at the beach house. Elle doesn't seem to bother that much and invites him to the water park that Marco had invited Elle to. Noah isn't that happy about it and leaves. The next day, Lee and Elle try to convince Noah to wear a costume for their race day. Noah denies and Lee leaves very frustratedly.

Ashton and Lee hang out a lot more than Elle expected. Marco stops by the restaurant where Elle works and says that everything is settled for Elle and Lee's event.

Noah and Chloe hang out on her family's boat. They talk for a while and afterwards Chloe's parents argue in the background.

Elle eventually finishes work and gets a call from her dad explaining that Brad's babysitter had canceled and Elle had to take care of him. She promised Noah and Chloe that she'll hang out with them, so Elle got a little bit creative. She asks Brad if he'll like to join her at the beach house and agrees. Elle asks if he wanted to eat anything but said that Linda already made him someone food. Linda accidentally bumps into Elle making her clothes wet. Elle isn't very happy about Linda being around and dating her dad, so she leaves in a hurry.

Back at the beach house, Elle and Chloe play some games and Chloe mentions she should go pro as she is very good at video games but she denies it. Later on, Lee, Ashton, and Rachel come home and Lee explains that they went to a comic book show and went 80's mini golfing.

Elle and Lee go to their favorite arcade and find a note on the DDR machine saying they would get rid of it.

Back at the restaurant, Lee and Elle are talking about how the DDR machine will be gone, so Lee added ""The last dance on the DDR machine"" to the bucket list. Elle is feeling very frustrated and overwhelmed about the bucket list, Harvard, and their friendship.

Elle goes to the beach house and finds Noah who made dinner for Elle to apologize for their last argument. Elle tells him that she is going with Lee for the bucket list but Noah isn't too thrilled about it so she walks away in tears. Later on, Elle, Lee, and all of their friends perform a flash mob in a restaurant. She gets a reminder and walks away from the restaurant and goes to the beach house.

The next morning, Noah is painting the doorway frame but Lee steps in and says that he shouldn't. Eventually, Noah walks away.

Elle, on the other hand, is picking up Brad from soccer but couldn't find him anywhere. Elle feels worried and goes home to find Brad. Brad is fine and tells Elle that Linda picked him up. Elle feels a little disappointed and angry about it. Back at work, Elle is feeling very frustrated. Chloe and Noah are on the beach talking about Elle. Chloe gets upset that Noah is giving up the same way her parents walk out of their marriage. Then, Elle and Marco have a small talk about her job, at Harvard, and her relationship with Noah and Lee.

Elle's about to finish work and someone enters. Then, she realizes it's Noah. They dance together and eventually make up. Then, Marco comes and sees through the window that Elle and Noah make amends. Marco feels disappointed and walks away.

The next day, Noah finds Elle's application letter from Berkeley. Elle calls Marco to apologize for last night. She explains what had happened and Marco understands but still feels a little disappointed. Noah tells Chloe about the letter at the Forth of July beach party. Marco shows up and Noah isn't okay with it. Elle and her friends play volleyball and Marco ends up punching Noah in the face because he assumes that he's still into Elle. Noah gives a dirty look at Marco and leaves. Elle is now very upset with Marco and pushes him away from her. Marco confesses his feelings for Elle but Elle rejects him.

That night, Elle's family, Rachel, Lee, and Lee's parents play Monopoly but Elle is still upset. Linda picks the dog piece but Elle takes it anyway. She explains that Linda can't replace her mother and walk into her life like that. Her father is very disappointed in Elle and walks away in fury.

Elle realizes where Noah could be and meets him at the Hollywood sign. They talk and Noah thinks that it's a good idea that they split up. Elle runs away devastated. And she realizes that she's too late to dance the last dance on the DDR machine. She finds Lee and they argue.

The next day, Chloe and Elle talk about Noah and Elle's relationship while Rachel overhears them. Rachel reconsiders her relationship with Lee. Elle and Mrs. Flynn talk about Elle's future and her choices. Rachel and Lee talk about their relationship and Rachel thinks they should break up too because of the distance. They end up in tears and hug each other.

At Elle's house, Elle apologizes to her father and Linda and explains to Linda that her mother used to always pick the dog piece. Linda understands and they make amends with each other. Then, she realizes what she's passionate about.

Everyone says their last goodbyes to each other. Elle explains how she got into Berkeley to Lee but she didn't want to crush their feelings and she decided to do what was best for her.

Elle roams around the beach house for the last time and remembers all the memories. Elle and Lee have their last talk and Lee leaves and takes the diamond doorknob with him.

tt8522006,"Abby Holland (Kristen Stewart) and Harper Caldwell (Mackenzie Davis) are a couple who have been dating nearly a year. Abby dislikes Christmas since her parents passed away a few year earlier, so Harper spontaneously invites Abby to celebrate the holidays with her family in her hometown of Pittsburgh. Abby sees this as the perfect opportunity to introduce herself to Harper's parents and propose to her on Christmas morning. However, on their way to the Caldwells' house, Harper reveals she lied to Abby about coming out to her parents; fearing doing so would interfere with her father's campaign for mayor, she doesn't want to come out to her family until after Christmas. She asks Abby to pretend to be her straight roommate for the holiday, to which Abby reluctantly agrees.

At the Caldwells' house, Abby meets Harper's father, Ted (Victor Garber), her perfectionist mother, Tipper (Mary Streenburgen), and her wacky younger sister, Jane (Mary Holland). The family welcomes Abby as Harper's ""orphan friend"" who has nowhere else to go for Christmas. Abby quickly becomes uncomfortable, especially when she meets Harper's exes, boyfriend Connor (Jake McDorman) and girlfriend Riley (Aubrey Plaza). During the visit, she begins questioning how much she knows about her girlfriend when she sees Ted and Tipper's high expectations and Harper's competitive relationship with her older sister, Sloane (Alison Brie).

Meanwhile, Ted is trying to impress a possible donor from the city council to contribute to his campaign, which Abby unwillingly jeopardizes when Sloane's children put an unpaid necklace into her bag at the mall and she is caught with it. Believing she is a shoplifter, Ted and Tipper think it might be better if they keep Abby away from upcoming social events. From this point, Abby feels even more like an outsider. She also learns from Riley that Harper denied her sexuality ever since she was a high school freshman during their romantic time together, which makes Abby more worried about the future of their relationship.

At the Caldwells' annual Christmas Eve party, Abby, having grown tired of her current situation, is relieved when her friend John (Daniel Levy) arrives unannounced to pick her up. Harper privately begs Abby to stay and as they are about to kiss, they are caught by Sloane who prepares to expose their relationship to the family. However, it turns out, Sloane has a secret of her own: she and her husband, Eric (Burl Moseley), are getting a divorce. The sisters get into a public fight, ruining the party. Sloane reveals in front of the guests that Harper is a lesbian and in a relationship with Abby..... which Harper denies immediately. Heartbroken by this, Abby leaves the house. John follows Abby outside, where the two talk about their stories of coming out to their respective families: Abby's parents were loving and accepting, while John's bigoted and homophobic father threw him out of the house and publicly disowned him forever. John reminds her that coming out can be terrifying for gay people, but has nothing to do with Harper's love for her.

After realizing that her fear of rejection by her parents caused her to hurt Riley and will cause her to lose Abby, Harper finally tells the truth to her parents, confirming that she is a lesbian. Predictably, both Ted and Tipper do not react well to this news. This inspires Sloane to reveal her own secret that she and her husband are getting divorced, and even Jane tells her parents how neglected she felt throughout the years. Harper goes after Abby to apologize, confessing that she truly loves her and wants to build a life with her. Touched by her words, Abby forgives her and they share a long and passionate kiss.

Ted apologizes to his daughters for making them feel they always had to be perfect. Then he gets a phone call from the donor he's been trying to impress, who will support him only if Harper stays quiet about her personal life. Ted rejects the offer. The Caldwells then take a family picture, with Abby included this time.

One year later, Abby and Harper are now engaged, Jane has become a bestselling author with her fantasy novel, 'The Shadow Dreamers', and Ted has won the mayoral election. On Christmas Eve, the family goes to the local retro cinema to watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'. As the movie starts, Abby and Harper smile at each other lovingly.",romance

They walk home, and we see Alana lives with her parents and two sisters (all played by Haim's real family), while Gary lives with his brother Greg (Milo Herschlag).Gary works with his mom, Momma Anita (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), and they meet with a restaurant owner, Jerry Frick (John Michael Higgins), and his wife Mioko (Yumi Mizui), over a new Japanese restaurant they are trying to open. Jerry speaks with a accent racist accent to his wife. Later on, Anita tells Gary that she can't accompany him for a trip to New York where he will be featured on auditions and a variety show.Alana accompanies Gary to New York, where he rejoins his movie partners from the film ""Under One Roof"", where he starred as one of many siblings along with renowned actress Lucille Dolittle (Christine Ebersole). During the show, Gary hits Lucille over the head with a pillow, and when being interviewed, he makes a joke about ""doing three beavers"". Lucille later angrily chastises him and hits him. Afterward, Gary meets with an agent, Gale (Maya Rudolph), and does a commercial for a vest. While this happens, Alana befriends another actor named Lance (Skyler Gisondo).Upon returning to California, Alana begins a relationship with Lance. However, when she brings him over for dinner with her family, he declines to say a prayer because, despite being raised in the Jewish faith, he identifies as an atheist. Alana breaks things off with him shortly afterward.Gary soon gets into the waterbed business and gets his friends Kirk (Will Arangola) and Mark (Griff Giacchino), along with Alana, now that they are becoming friends, although Gary is still in love with her. They go to an expo called Soggy Bottom, where there are other booths like one for ""The Munsters"", with Fred Gwynne (John C. Reilly) in attendance. As Gary tries to sell the water beds, cops come to aggressively arrest him on suspicion of murder. Alana runs all the way to the police station, where Gary is soon let go when their first suspect says he doesn't know Gary. He leaves the station and hugs Alana.Alana operates the phones at the waterbed business, with Gary telling her to sound ""sexier"", but he feels she overdoes it. He later accompanies her to meet an agent, Mary Grady (Harriet Sansom Harris). When she asks Alana if she would do nudity in films, she initially says yes, but Gary urges her to say no. The two argue on the way home because Gary isn't comfortable with audiences seeing Alana nude when he can't. She later relents and shows him her breasts but slaps him when he asks to touch them.Alana joins Gary at an event to sell waterbeds, where Gary meets a girl from school named Sue Pomerantz (Isabelle Kusman). The two chat and go off to hook up, which Alana sees and appears jealous for it. She randomly kisses another guy out of spite and then walks home in nothing but her underwear (as she was modeling that way).Later on, Alana goes to an audition for a part alongside actor Jack Holden (Sean Penn). He takes a liking to her and compares her to Grace Kelly. Jack takes Alana to a bar, ""The Tail o' the Cock"", where Gary and his friends also make an appearance. Jack runs into his old friend, director Rex Blau (Tom Waits), and they convince everyone in attendance to watch Jack recreate a motorcycle stunt from his film ""The Bridges of Toko-San"", which he did with Kelly. Alana sits on the back of the motorcycle, but as soon as Jack takes off, Alana falls backwards. Gary runs all the way to Alana to make sure she is okay while everyone else cheers for Jack. He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis, which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds, since they are made from vinyl, and vinyl is made from oil. The two, plus Greg, Kirk, and Mark, later deliver a waterbed to the home of producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper), who is something of a lunatic. He grills Gary for the pronunciation of his girlfriend's name (being Barbra Streisand), and explicitly threatens to kill Gary's whole family if he messes anything up during the setup. Gary and Alana set up the water bed, but accidentally pull the hose out and get the carpet wet. They get the other three boys out of there quickly.On their way out, they run into Jon coming up a hill, where he forces them to take him to the gas station to fill up since his car broke down. They leave him there when they see Jon threatening to light a man on fire by spraying him with the gas nozzle while holding a lighter. They drive back towards Jon's car, where Gary starts to smash the windshield. Unfortunately, their truck runs out of gas, and they have to roll the truck carefully down the hills backwards until it eventually stops in the middle of the street somewhere. Gary and the boys go off to get gas, while Alana sits on the street. Jon walks nearby and throws a garbage bin through a store window, but she manages to avoid being seen by him before he tries to hit on two tennis players.With the waterbed business failing from the gas crisis, Gary and Alana look to move onto other work. Gary invests in a pinball arcade while Alana decides to do volunteer work for mayoral candidate Councilman Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). Gary and Alana have an argument, leading to them parting ways.While Alana is taking calls at the campaign office, she notices a creepy guy (Jon Beavers) scoping the office out. She confronts him but he gives her vague responses as to why he is there. Alana is later invited to drinks with Wachs, where the creepy guy is sitting nearby again. She meets Wachs' partner Matthew (Joseph Cross), and Alana learns that Wachs is gay and that the creep is most likely a spy trying to dig up dirt on Wachs and his campaign. Wachs asks Alana to go home with Matthew and pretend that she is his girlfriend. When they get home, Matthew breaks down in tears, asking Alana if she has a boyfriend. She says ""yes and no"", but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade, dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana's friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there. Similarly, Alana goes to the restaurant where she first went out with Gary, but he isn't there. They eventually keep going until they literally run into each other in front of the movie theater. Gary brings Alana back to the arcade and introduces her as ""Mrs. Alana Valentine"". She calls him an idiot, but he then kisses her.The two run off again together, with Alana telling Gary that she loves him.",comedy
tt9115530,"Tamara ""Tammy"" Faye LaValley falls in love with Jim Bakker while studying at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The two marry despite disapproval from Tammy's mother Rachel, dropping out of college to preach and inspire Christian communities across the United States. Their preaching gets the attention of Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, who hires them as hosts of children's show Jim and Tammy. Jim later becomes the first host of CBN's The 700 Club (1966) while the two welcome daughter Tammy Sue.

Tammy and Jim meet conservative pastor Jerry Falwell during a party, with Jerry expressing interest in working with CBN. Following an argument with Falwell in which Tammy dismisses the politicization of faith, she encourages Jim to create their own television network so that they can have control over their own programs. The two leave CBN and create the PTL Satellite Network, with their flagship show The PTL Club (1974) becoming popular over the years. Tammy invites Rachel and stepfather Fred to move in with them at their Tega Cay, South Carolina compound, after which Rachel expresses her growing suspicions over how PTL gets its money.

As the press becomes more skeptical and critical of PTL's handling of its finances, Tammy becomes flirtatious with music producer Gary S. Paxton, whom Jim fires following the birth of their son Jay. In the 1980s, Jim then focuses his attention on building a Christian theme park while Tammy becomes addicted to pills and discouraged by Falwell's political oversight. Fallwell decries the ""gay cancer."" She invites AIDS patient and Christian pastor Steve Pieters for an interview about supporting the gay community, much to Falwell's disapproval.

After collapsing during a taping, Tammy argues with Jim over their strained relationship. Falwell takes control of PTL following news scandals about PTL's financial debt and Jim's extramarital affairs, including speculations about sexual relationships with men. Jim is ultimately imprisoned for fraud.

By 1992, Tammy and Jim have officially divorced, Rachel has died, and Tammy is struggling to revive her career and find television gigs. She gets an offer to be the special guest for a Christian concert at Oral Roberts University, which she hesitantly accepts. She preaches before performing a moving rendition of Battle Hymn of the Republic, during which she imagines a rousing gospel choir performing with her.

A textual epilogue reveals Falwell died in 2007, Jim returned to televangelism for a revived PTL after being released from prison, and Tammy continued to support LGBTQ+ communities until she died in 2007.",romance

tt12477480,"An insomniac detective, Hae-Jun, works in Busan and only sees his wife, Jung-An, a nuclear power plant worker residing in Ipo, once a week. Hae-Jun and his partner Soo-Wan encounter a case where a retired immigration worker, Ki Do Soo, is found dead at the foot of a mountain he often climbed. They interview his much younger wife, Seo-Rae, an emigrant from China who works as a caretaker for seniors. They suspect her because of her insufficient displays of grief, a scratch on her hand, bruises on her legs and torso, and a tattoo of Ki's initials in the manner that he marked his other belongings.

Hae-Jun does nightly stakeouts outside of Seo-Rae's apartment building, becoming obsessed with her and imagining himself inside her apartment. Seo-Rae discovers him stalking her and tails his other investigations in turn. Seo-Rae's Monday client says that Seo-Rae was with her on the day that Ki died. Seo-Rae admits that in China, she killed her mother with fentanyl pills because her mother was terminally ill and asked her to do so. Before dying, she told Seo-Rae to go to Korea to claim the mountain her Korean grandfather, an independence fighter in Manchuria, had left her. Soo-Wan and Hae-Jun discover letters from Ki admitting to being a corrupt immigration official and a letter sent to Ki's subordinate that they interpret as a suicide letter. Hae-Jun concludes that the death is a suicide and informs Seo-Rae that she is no longer a suspect.

Seo-Rae and Hae-Jun go on a date at a Buddhist temple, visit each other's homes, and become close. Seo-Rae burns the photo evidence from her husband's case, reasoning that Hae-Jun's insomnia is caused by his haunting cases. One day, she has Hae-Jun substitute for her at her Monday client. Hae-Jun learns that Seo-Rae and the client have the same model of cell phone, and the client has dementia and does not know the day of the week. On the client's cell phone, he sees that the housebound woman apparently walked up 138 flights of stairs on the day of Ki's death. Hae-Jun realizes that Seo-Rae switched phones with her client on the day of the murder and then climbed the mountain to push Ki off. She also forged his suicide note and got close to Hae-Jun to destroy his evidence. Hae-Jun tells Seo-Rae that she has destroyed his pride in his job and that, since meeting her, he has become ""shattered"", but instructs her to throw the incriminating phone into the sea.

Thirteen months later, Hae-Jun has moved to Ipo to live with Jung-An after developing depression and more severe insomnia. At the fish market with Jung-An, he encounters Seo-Rae with Im Ho-Shin, her new husband, a business investor. The next day, Ho-Shin is found dead in his mansion's swimming pool. Hae-Jun is convinced Seo-Rae is the culprit. She admits only to draining the pool so that Hae-Jun would not be disturbed by the blood. Sa Cheol-Seong, a Chinese immigrant, soon confesses to killing Ho-Shin for defrauding his late mother of millions of dollars. Sa denies that Seo-Rae played any role and reveals he had installed a tracker on Seo-Rae's phone so he knew where she was at all times. Hae-Jun learns that Seo-Rae visited Sa's mother in the hospital and the mother died later that day. He concludes that Seo-Rae slipped the mother the remaining fentanyl pills she had in her possession, because Sa had threatened to kill Ho-Shin as soon as his mother died.

Jung-An leaves Hae-Jun, suspecting an affair with Seo-Rae. Hae-Jun confronts Seo-Rae at the mountain her grandfather left her. She tells him that Ho-Shin had discovered a phone recording where Hae-Jun told Seo-Rae that he loved her and he had threatened to expose their illicit relationship. Hae-Jun doesn't recall telling Seo-Rae that he loved her, though she says she began loving him as he stopped loving her. She reaches Hae-Jun at the edge of the mountain and hugs him. They kiss passionately.

The next day, while Seo-Rae drives to the beach, Hae-Jun finds the cell phone with the recording. In it, he tells Seo-Rae to destroy the phone with incriminating evidence from Ki's case. At a beach, Seo-Rae digs a pit in the sand and gets in it as the tide rises, letting it drown and bury her, so that she will forever remain an unsolved mystery in Hae-Jun's mind. Hae-Jun arrives at the beach and is unable to find Seo-Rae, although he is actually standing on her grave. He searches desperately for her and cries in anguish.",romance

tt9686790,"The film opens on an island resort in the Philippines. Families and friends are gathered for the wedding of Darcy Rivera (Jennifer Lopez) and Tom Fowler (Josh Duhamel). Darcy shows up to a dinner where she meets with her mother, Renata (Sonia Braga), who thinks the big wedding is too flashy. Meanwhile, Tom is setting up a surprise for Darcy on a motorboat but gets startled by the security guard, causing him to fall into the water.

Tom's mother, Carol (Jennifer Coolidge), arrives with her second husband, Larry (Steve Coulter). At the same time, Darcy's father, Robert (Cheech Marin), shows up with his new younger girlfriend, Harriet (D'Arcy Carden), which annoys Renata since she still hates Robert after their divorce. While Darcy and Tom try to spend time together, Tom gets pulled away by his best friend/best man Ricky (Desmin Borges), leaving Darcy to be with her younger sister Jamie (Callie Hernandez). Complicating matters is the arrival of Darcy's charming ex-boyfriend Sean (Lenny Kravitz), who was invited by Robert. He calls Darcy ""Dee Dee,"" and his presence puts Tom on edge, with everyone seeing he is clearly jealous. Tom delivers a speech that is upstaged by Sean's more personal speech toward Darcy. This is followed by Tom's sister Jeannie (Melissa Hunter) delivering a speech discussing her recent marital problems.

Darcy and Tom try to wind down and get intimate with one another, but it is interrupted by Carol coming in to offer words that she thinks are encouraging, but they really aren't. The couple ends up sleeping separately.

The next morning is wedding day. As preparations are being made, a group of pirates makes their way toward the island after seeing the couple's wedding website. Darcy is helped by Renata, Jamie, and Carol into her dress, but she feels that something isn't right. She texts Tom to meet privately, and Darcy says she feels that having everyone come to the Philippines for their wedding was too much, as she never wanted a big wedding. They argue until they decide that they ought to call off the wedding, just as the pirates storm the resort and take the staff and guests hostage. Tom witnesses this and runs to warn Darcy. The pirates force everyone into a pool and demand a $45 million ransom from Robert, as they know how wealthy he is.

Tom gets Darcy out of her room and tells her what's happening. They see an armed pirate attempting to break in and try to come up with a plan to trap him. While they attempt to subdue him with their own ideas (Tom wants to trap him in a net while Darcy thinks spraying his eyes with hairspray would do the trick), they both get taken down and are tied up together. The pirates then head with the couple to bring them to their leader, but Darcy asks for a cigarette and uses it to light the pirates' heads on fire, causing them to jump out and leaving the couple to try and take control of the driver less cart. They manage to jump out, but Darcy's dress gets caught and is mostly ripped off as the cart falls over a cliff. They are then attacked by one of the pirates, but Darcy manages to pull a grenade from his hand, and Tom kicks him and makes him fall against a rock, killing him. This leaves him mortified at killing a man.

Darcy and Tom try to find a way to untie themselves, but Tom informs Darcy to be careful with the grenade she is holding because it doesn't have a pin in it, and her dropping it could set it off. They try to find an area with good cell reception so they can call for help, but they get chased by more pirates, and Darcy drops the phone. They find a zip line tower where they descend, and Darcy drops the grenade on two pirates, which alerts the others to their location when it blows up. When the couple lands, they are scared to see their loved ones being held hostage and try to find a way to get help.

The couple goes into the kitchen to find a way to cut their bindings. A female pirate enters just as they cut themselves free with a deli slicer (but Tom gets a nasty cut on his hand that makes Darcy faint). Tom fights the pirate until he knocks her out by smashing her through a glass window. When Darcy comes to her senses, she shortens her dress and wears boots so she can spring into action and help Tom save their loved ones.

Darcy and Tom find the main office of the resort but find that they have no internet. The owners, Margy (Selena Tan) and Ace (Alberto Isaac), hide the couple in their bunker. While tending to Tom's wound, Margy lets it slip that the resort was hit by pirates the previous summer, which Tom had known about. Darcy yells at Tom over this and his habit of self-sabotaging and his insecurities, which is what led him to make the big wedding. Tom hits back that Darcy is putting on a big front of being confident when she is also scared. Tom then takes responsibility for the hostages since he brought them all there. When another pirate starts getting close, Ace and Margy send the couple down a tunnel, but Tom gets out and turns himself in to be captured, leaving Darcy hidden.

Tom is brought to the other hostages. He tells the lead pirate a phrase in Balinese (which means ""fuck your grandpa""), and he then holds Sean at knife-point. Tom deduced that Sean is the bad guy who hired the pirates because Sean had said the phrase earlier, and Tom figured the pirates are Balinese. He even produces a wedding invitation that one of the pirates had, and Tom states that Sean had hoped to get the ransom from Robert since he did not give him investment money. Sean drops the act and breaks free, joining the pirates and holding a gun at Tom.

Darcy begins to feel bad while staying with Ace and Margy over her argument with Tom, so she is encouraged to save everyone herself. Sean takes the lead pirate with him to go find Darcy, using Harriet as collateral and taking her with him in his helicopter. Darcy arrives with a gun and tries to reconcile with Tom before taking on the pirates. The pirates end up taking Darcy with the other hostages, with one of the pirates personally wanting to kill Darcy because she burned his face. The others then learn that Harriet was in on the scheme the whole time, as Larry had been recording everything and got footage of her and Sean making out. While in the helicopter, Harriet kills the lead pirate by hitting a pressure point to paralyze him and then throws him out of the helicopter.

Darcy and Tom devise a plan by doing an impromptu wedding ceremony in the pool, which the pirates allow. Carol leads everyone to sing the song ""I'll Be"" before the couple seizes an opportunity to fight back (with Carol getting her hands on a rifle too). They use another grenade to kill the pirates, setting off some fireworks that alert Sean and Harriet. Ace and Margy help the guests get to safety while Darcy and Tom try to stop the villains.

The couple makes it to the docks, where they subdue a young pirate and try to take the motorboat that Tom was going to surprise Darcy with. They are found by Sean, who attempts to get Darcy on his side, but she refuses to join him. She and Tom hop in the boat while Sean hangs on to go after them. Harriet attempts to shoot at them from the helicopter. As Darcy speeds the boat up, Tom and Sean get caught in a para-sail that flies upwards. Tom uses a chunk of fake hair to zip line down, and Darcy uses a cake knife that Carol gave her to cut the para-sail loose, causing Sean to get shredded by the helicopter's blades, and Harriet goes down into the ocean when the helicopter crashes.

Darcy and Tom make it back to the island, where they fully reconcile and agree to go on with their wedding. Authorities show up to arrest the surviving pirates, and Darcy and Tom finally get married. Jamie and Ricky (who were hooking up) then accidentally set off the last firework.",romance
tt9054192,"A pair of housewives create a  million coupon scam.A team of FBI agents burst into the home of Connie Kaminski Kristen Bell to arrest her. Her voiceover narration says that she is getting ahead of herself in the story, so she goes back to the beginning.Almost a year earlier, Connie is shown being jobless and saving money with coupons. She is married to IRS agent Rick Joel McHale, who is unpleasant and unsupportive toward Connie, only telling her to get a job instead of being home stocking up on products that she bought with coupons. They have also tried to conceive a child, but Connie suffered a miscarriage and they are paying off debts from fertility treatments. Connie is best friends with Joanna ""JoJo"" Johnson Kirby HowellBaptiste, who lives with her mother, Mama Josie Greta Oglesby. JoJo has been unable to secure proper employment since she had her identity stolen, so she makes YouTube videos to try and generate revenue. The local mailman, Earl Dayo Okeniyi, has an obvious crush on JoJo.After a particularly frustrating day, Connie writes a complaint letter to General Mills about the Wheaties she ate being stale, and soon, she receives a coupon for a free box of cereal. She then learns from JoJo that companies do this all the time, so she writes multiple complaint letters to receive multiple free coupons. The ladies then learn that the coupons come from a factory in Chihuahua, Mexico, and they hatch a plan to head down there and collect the coupons to redistribute to other moms and wives.In Carson City, Nevada, Ken Miller Paul Walter Hauser works as an agent to prevent losses for certain stores and companies. He chides a woman at a store for attempting to use a fake coupon for a discount, even though the cashier is willing to let it slide. Ken travels back to his home in Salt Lake City, where he is just lonely.Connie and JoJo make their travel to Mexico and encounter a couple, Alejandro Francisco Rodriguez and Rosa Ilia Paulino, who agree to help them out by taking the unused coupons. Once they get their hands on them, the ladies begin their own website and small business ""Savvy Super Saver"", which helps them sell a lot of coupons and generate profit. However, this also catches the attention of Ken, who learns about the coupons and the losses some companies are taking. Ken annoys his superiors until he makes it an official case that he can take on.The ladies' account is frozen due to suspicious activity, so Connie finds out they need to prove they are a legitimate business. With that, they must turn to the hacker that stole JoJo's identity, Tempe Tina Bebe Rexha. They get in touch with Tina and are taken to her secret location, where she instructs Connie and JoJo on how to keep their operation lowkey and how to keep their money secure, including by using JoJo's cosmetics brand Back  Black as a front for their coupon business.After six months, Connie and JoJo figure their money is safe to use, but because it's dirty money, they need to spend it and clean it. They start buying things like sports cars, boats, planes, and guns. Meanwhile, Ken is partnered with a rep from the post office named Simon Kilmurry Vince Vaughn. Tempe Tina then contacts Connie and JoJo for their overspending and tells them that their money was always clean, and now their purchases are just making them look more suspicious. Tina tells them to take money out from the bank in small increments and to get rid of all their big purchases.JoJo later takes Connie to the fertility clinic where she decides to give it another shot at getting pregnant. Instead of using Rick's sample, she uses an anonymous donor instead. They later sell off their guns to a militia.Ken and Simon bond on their mission, with Simon sympathizing with Ken for how much devotion he puts to the job. They go around interviewing people from grocery stores where the ladies have shopped, and almost all of them recognize Connie because they find her constant use of coupons to be irritating. They are even able to place her behind the super saver website because their slogan is the same phrase that Connie uses when she shops. When they interview a group of postal workers, they remember JoJo because Earl is always watching her videos. He ends up trying to warn her while Ken and Simon try and stake out by her house.After gathering more evidence on the women, Ken and Simon are able to get agents to go and arrest Connie and JoJo. The two are placed in jail, but while JoJo is let out on bail, Connie is only visited by Rick so he can admonish her for what she has done. Having had enough of his lack of support, she declares that she wants a divorce. The ladies are then put on trial, where JoJo is given ten days in prison plus a year of probation, while Connie is sentenced to eleven months, but possibly eight with good behavior. Ken thinks they were let off too easy, but the companies that the ladies ripped off just wanted the case swept under the rug to avoid bad publicity.JoJo begins a relationship with Earl and relocates to Montenegro where they can keep using the makeup business front and continue the coupon business there to avoid the law. Connie stocks up on goods in prison and has gotten pregnant. She continues to try and look on the upside as she makes it through her sentence. thanks to Jeremy  themoviespoiler",comedy

tt9354842,"Lara Jean Covey's (Lana Condor) high school sets up a volunteer program; while her boyfriend Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) goes to volunteer with his friends, Lara Jean decides to go to Belleview Retirement Home instead, since that's where her older sister Margot (Janel Parrish) went. On her first day there, she meets Stormy, an eccentric old lady who Margot often talked about and accidentally slips on a pile of gumballs after discovering that John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher) is also volunteering at Belleview. They talk about the letter, and John Ambrose agrees to let Lara Jean read the letter as long as she gives it back to him afterward. Lara Jean is unable to stop thinking about their conversation and, in addition, is constantly insecure about her relationship with Peter because she can't stop comparing herself with her ex-best friend (and Peter's ex-girlfriend) Gen (Emilija Baranac).

On Valentine's Day, Lara Jean witnesses her classmates being serenaded by special a Capella groups and is told by a friend that Peter sent a group to serenade Gen every period, back when they were still dating. This enhances her insecurity, though she forgets about this when she meets with Peter later that day. He gives her a silver necklace and reads a poem he brought for her, which she believes is original but turns out to be two verses of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabel Lee"" with Lara Jean's name replacing the words ""Annabel Lee"". She is later told by Stormy about the true nature of the poem, which upsets her. He apologizes and tells her he wishes he could write something like that for her, though he means everything in the poem.

While volunteering at Belleview, Lara Jean and John Ambrose grow closer and decide to throw a Star Ball for Belleview after discovering some old decorations in the basement; John Ambrose appears to be catching feelings for Lara Jean, who tries but is unable to tell him about her relationship with Peter.

However, Gen claims that she didn't put any in the time capsule when they find it empty earlier than they expected.

The next day, Lara Jean apologizes to John Ambrose for not telling him about Peter, which he forgives her for. She decides to dress up for Peter's game and is waiting for Peter to come out but is pulled aside by Chris to tell her that she saw him with Gen earlier, showing her a photo of them holding each other. Lara Jean confronts Peter and realizes that Peter never stopped talking to Gen and on the ski trip, Peter was waiting for Gen at the hot tub and not Lara Jean, as he was planning to get back together with Gen that night and he and Lara Jean would never have gotten together for real. That is why the video of LJ and Peter at the hot tub was leaked. Gen knew where Peter was going to be. With Peter being in a rush to get to the game, he tells Lara Jean they will have to talk about it later, but she's too hurt and breaks up with him. Lara Jean goes to the tree house sometime later and meets up with Gen, who reveals that Peter was only comforting her as her parents were separating. She says that she only went to Peter because he had undergone the same experience, that Peter is crazy about Lara Jean, and that she shouldn't be doubting him. She also reveals that she had, in fact, put something in the time capsule (a friendship bracelet that matched the bracelet Lara Jean put in the capsule) and was just too embarrassed to show it. Lara Jean starts to realize that she was the one who always had Gen on her mind, not Peter, and makes up with Gen.

John whispers to LJ stating that Peter's there and she apologizes to him and rushes outside in her dress, only to find Peter waiting outside for her.

tt18411490,"In 1999 in London, a teenage Zoya (Katrina Kaif) witnesses her father, ISI agent Rehan Nazar (Aamir Bashir), die in a bomb blast. Rehan had taught Zoya that a person who kills without a reason is a terrorist and not a soldier. Rehan was a supporter of democracy and was eliminated after Musharraf came to power after removing Nawaz Sharif from the post of PM of Pakistan. After his funeral, she is visited by Nazar's protege, Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi), who convinces her to join the ISI. Zoya believes that India was responsible for the death of her father.

In the present, Avinash ""Tiger"" Singh Rathore (Salman Khan) is called for a mission by the new RAW chief Maithili Menon (Revathi) to rescue Tiger's former handler Gopi Arya (Ranvir Shorey), who was captured in Afghanistan after trying to extract information from the Taliban about a mission being planned in Pakistan. Following his rescue, Gopi reveals to Tiger that Zoya is involved in the planned mission and succumbs to his injuries. This effectively means that Zoya is a double agent, pretending to be associated with RAW, but secretly working for the ISI. Zoya is at their home in Austria with their son Junior. Tiger begins to spy on Zoya and is later assigned to safeguard a RAW agent named Jibran Sheikh (Neeraj Purohit) in St. Petersburg, Russia, who worked with Gopi and escaped to the country after being discovered in Pakistan. Jibran was the arms supplier to the outfit inside Pakistan, which was planning the massive mission. He has vital information about the players involved in the new outfit.

Pakistan PM Nasreen Irani is a peace advocate and advocates a 50% cut in Pakistan's defense budget, if India also reciprocates. Zoya tells Tiger that Nasreen has painted a target on herself by announcing the budget cuts as the future of Pakistan is decided by the Army.

Tiger witnesses Zoya's attempt to assassinate Sheikh; after saving him. Tiger is unable to shoot at Zoya and is captured by Aatish. Aatish reveals that he enforced Zoya to assassinate Sheikh by near-fatally drugging and kidnapping her and Tiger's son Junior (Sartaaj Kakkar). In a flashback twelve years prior, It is revealed that Aatish sought to derail a peace treaty between India and Pakistan in Vienna by assassinating the General Ribiero, Chief of the Army Staff (India) (Bimal Oberoi). Aatish is against any attempts between India and Pakistan to make any progress towards peace or normal relations. After refusing to cooperate with the plan (she says that she works for Pakistan and not Aatish), Zoya covertly informs Tiger. Aatish's pregnant wife, Shaheen Baig (Riddhi Dogra), attempts the assassination herself, but was shot and killed by Tiger. Aatish denied that his agents knew of the plan and was subsequently imprisoned and ousted from the ISI.

Back in the present, Aatish reveals that he has Junior in his custody and wants Tiger and Zoya to carry out his mission in exchange for Junior's life. Tiger and Zoya recruit their team of RAW agents Rakesh (Kumud Mishra), Karan (Anant Vidhaat Sharma) and Nikhil (Chandrachoor Rai), to steal a briefcase for Aatish, containing missile launch codes in Istanbul in exchange for Junior. Zoya brings the briefcase to Aatish while Tiger is pursued and arrested by the Turkish police, who was informed by Aatish.

Aatish then has Tiger and Zoya framed as traitors by their respective countries, leading to Tiger's detention at an army prison in Northern Pakistan. Aatish knows that now both ISI and RAW are enemies of Zoya and Tiger. Pakistan will believe that the duo has stolen the codes to deliver to India, while India will believe that Tiger and Zoya plan to launch the nukes at them. The Indian Government brands Tiger as a rogue agent and asks the PM of Pakistan to conduct his trial as their laws. Meanwhile ISI dispatches their agents after Zoya to recover their launch codes. Menon also asks Rakesh, Karan and Nikhil to recover the codes to avoid jail. Tiger is sentenced to death but manages to escape with the help of Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan).

Tiger then travels to Islamabad where he meets his adopted son, Hassan (Vishal Jethwa), whom Tiger had rescued in a mission in Ikrit.

The RAW team and the ISI agents reach Zoya at the same time. Zoya convinces both teams that Aatish is behind stealing the launch codes. Tiger's team, Zoya and ISI agents Abrar (Gavie Chahal) and Javed (Danish Bhat) return to Islamabad, where they learn from Tiger that Aatish and Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General Imtiaz Haq (Shahid Latief) are planning to assassinate Prime Minister of Pakistan Nasreen Irani (Simran) in order for Aatish to replace her. Tiger, Zoya, and their team secretly enter the Pakistan's PMO and reveal the plan to Irani. Zoya says that Aatish had kidnapped their son to force them to steal the launch codes. Irani is convinced when Haq enters the PMO and starts attacking his way to Irani's office. Tiger and Zoya take Irani to an underground bunker and Tiger forces Haq to publicly reveal the plan.

However, Aatish secretly kills Haq (with a long-range rifle) with the help of Javed, who is revealed to be Shaheen's brother and frames Tiger for killing Haq. Aatish broadcasts live and declares that he has the launch codes, while Tiger has kept Irani captive and killed Haq. Aatish uses Javed, whose treachery is not revealed to Tiger and Zoya, to find their positions inside the PMO. Abrar and Karan are killed by Aatish and Javed, who locate Irani. But Zoya and Tiger manage to capture Aatish as they already knew that Javed was Shaheen's brother. But tables are turned when Javed captures Hassan. Hassan sacrifices himself, allowing Tiger and Zoya to regroup and form a strategy. Zoya takes Irani out of the bunker to safety, while Tiger engages Aatish inside the bunker.

Zoya avenges Abrar and Karan's deaths by killing Javed. Tiger and Aatish engage in a combat, resulting in Tiger killing Aatish. Irani broadcasts her speech from inside the PMO and exposes Aatish's plot to the public and Tiger, Zoya and their team are proven innocent. Tiger contacts Menon and assures her that he will always be there to serve his country.

tt10618286,"1930s Hollywood is re-evaluated through the eyes of scathing social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the screenplay of Citizen Kane (1941). In 1940, film studio RKO 1940 hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies. For his first film, he calls in washed-up alcoholic Herman J. Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is ""Citizen Kane,"" and this is the story of how it was written. Holed up in the secluded North Verde Ranch in the middle of the Mojave Desert, bedridden American screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz has 60 short days to turn in the first draft of the Citizen Kane (1941) screenplay. Grappling with alcohol addiction, Herman J. Mankiewicz collaborates with Orson Welles, Hollywood's 24-year-old golden boy, and gets to work. As RKO had already given Orson Welles carte blanche, Herman J. Mankiewicz decides to draw inspiration from his days working for MGM, his friendship with newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and Hearst's 20-year-old girlfriend, actress Marion Davies of the Ziegfeld Follies. Mank captures the life of Mankiewicz between essentially 1933 and 1940, when America was in the midst of the Depression and watching uneasily, but from far, the gathering clouds of World War II. There is another presence that Fincher does well to focus on in his telling of the making of Citizen Kane, the candidacy of Left-leaning Upton Sinclair for the governorship of California, which sees the tinsel town gang up against him. As Sinclair is portrayed as promoting ""anti-American"" values, with MGM lending its might to a campaign that would now be described as fake news, Mank is forced to confront his own compromises and little lies.In a marvelous scene, Dance's Hearst recounts Oldman's Mank the ""parable of the organ grinder's monkey"", just after the latter has humiliated himself and Hearst in a drunken rant about the sold idealism of the newspaper baron. While the monkey thinks it is him running the show, Hearst reminds Mank, he has to ""dance"", ""every time"", the music plays.That realization is a glimpse of the bitterness that would eventually lead Mank to finding himself jobless in Hollywood, particularly after his decision to take on Hearst with Welles backing. It would also lead him to Citizen Kane - while on the bed with a broken leg, awayfrom friends and family and fighting for a drink despite alcohol slowly claiming him - as wellas his only Oscar.As Mank explains it to a friend, ""We have got a huge responsibility, to people in the dark willingly checking their disbelief at the door.",comedy

Later, her mother requests her to take her back to India as she wants to spend her last days there. Eventually after a few months her mother dies and Anvitha starts feeling lonely. As she doesn't believe in marriage, she tries to become a mother through IUI, as she feels she too needs a person during her last days.

tt7242142,"While on probation, a man begins to re-evaluate his relationship with his volatile best friend. Collin (Daveed Diggs) must make it through his final three days of probation for a chance at a new beginning. He and his troublemaking childhood best friend Miles (Rafael Casal) work as movers and are forced to watch their old neighborhood become a trendy spot in the rapidly-gentrifying Bay Area. When a life-altering event causes Collin to miss his mandatory curfew, the two men struggle to maintain their friendship as the changing social landscape exposes their differences. Explores the intersection of race and class set against the backdrop of Oakland. In West Oakland, Collin Hopkins, a Black man who works for the Commander Moving Company as a mover, is a convicted felon on the last three days of his one-year parole. Among the many restrictions contained within his parole are living in a halfway house which has its own additional rules, having curfew, not being allowed outside of Alameda County, and no possession of firearms; contravention of any of these items could extend the length of his parole, or worse, send him back to prison. Collin, whose felony was largely a matter of unexpected circumstance, wants to do the right thing and lead a straight life. And despite having made it through the first 362 days of his parole, it isn't a guarantee that he will make it to the end clear, let alone make to the end at all due to the environment in which he lives, which includes people, like him, of a lower socioeconomic standing having to adjust to the gentrification happening within the community. One of the larger threats is his association with Miles Jones, his married best friend since they were kids and his moving partner. Miles, a Caucasian, feels like he has something to prove being white and living in West Oakland, something that Collin inherently doesn't have to prove being Black. But what could be the biggest threat to Collin is being haunted in witnessing a white police officer shoot a fleeing Black man to death in the back late in the evening of the third to last day of his parole--being shot for no reason by the police, something that Black people like Collin face every day. Through it all, Collin tries to negotiate his relationship with Val, his girlfriend before his incarceration and the dispatcher at Commander, who is taking more outward steps to improve her life to match that gentrification which may not include associating personally with someone like Collin, especially in light of having seen the aftermath of what sent him to prison.",comedy

Even though they have enough money and do not need anymore, Arielle still goes off on her own to commit a robbery at a gas station and accidentally kills a customer who startled her. The clerk manages to grab a gun and shoots Arielle in the shoulder as she flees.

Dean is extremely upset that everyone now knows where they are. The police have found them and thus begins a car chase and a shootout. They realize that they left their money behind. Once they get away from the police, Dean removes the bullet from her shoulder. Arielle takes pictures of her wounds for her followers, making Dean angry again.

The next day, Elle drives them through a police checkpoint. Once they are through, they give Elle a bottle of water and take her car, directing her to walk back to the gas station they passed and to report her car stolen to get the insurance reimbursement.

On the other hand, Kyle becomes upset after not being able to find the money they expected and in anger shoots a bank worker.

He subdues the creature but is crushed by a bell. Waking up in a hospital, the town doctor (Anthony Mendez) informs him that he has lost eight of his nine lives and suggests Puss should retire. That night in a bar, Puss meets a black-hooded wolf (Wagner Moura), who disarms and wounds him in a sword-fight. Puss is not able to mount any resistance to the Wolf and is scared for the first time in his lifeTraumatized, Puss flees to the house of cat lady Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), where he buries his clothes and meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat whom he calls Perrito (Harvey GuillÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©n) (a friendly and naive therapy dog who started out as one of Mama Luna's pet cats). Puss is bored by the sedated lifestyle at Mama Luna's. He shares the place with many many other cats and has no identity left what-so-ever.Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family (Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone) & baby bear (Samson Kayo)) soon arrive at Luna's home. They plan to hire Puss to steal a map bearing the Wishing Star's location from pastry chef and crime boss ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney), but fail to recognize Puss in Boots and leave after finding his ""grave"" (where Puss had buried his clothes and sword). Puus overhears Goldi talking about the map to the Wishing Star and that the map will be with Big Jack Horner.Horner, a feared pastry chef and crime lord who plans to use the Wishing Star to gain control of all magicPuss decides to use the Star to restore his lost lives. Accompanied by Perrito, he breaks into Horner's bakery to steal the map, but is interrupted by his resentful ex-fiance Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) (a street-savvy Tuxedo cat who is Puss' ex-fiance, and seeks the Wishing Star to find somebody she can trust), Horner, and Goldi and the bears. Puss manages to escape with the map alongside Kitty and Perrito, though he sees the wolf threaten him while fleeing.The map leads the trio to the Dark Forest, a pocket dimension that changes its landscape depending on the map's holder. Puss and Kitty get the path with the most deadly obstacles, but Perrito's path is littered with rainbows and rivers of relaxation. Puss and Kitty hand the map to Perrito.Meanwhile the bears, Goldi and Horner are in pursuit of the trio. At the Pocket Full of Posies, giant roses block their path. Perrito gets them through by simply smelling the roses. Horner follows and uses his Phoenix to burn the entire rose meadow down.During another clash with Horner, his henchmen, and Goldi and the bears, Puss sees the wolf again and runs off, distracting Kitty and allowing Goldi to obtain the map. After Perrito calms Puss' panic attack, Puss confesses to being on his last life, and his remorse for leaving Kitty on their wedding day. Kitty overhears them and reveals that she never attended the wedding either, believing Puss could not love anyone more than himself.Puss and Kitty steal back the map while Goldi and the bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage where Goldi and the bears first met (Goldi's path went through Nostalgic Pines). As the dimension shifts, Puss accidentally traps himself in a crystalline cave (In the Caves of Lost Souls), where he encounters his arrogant past lives, and the wolf, who reveals himself as Death. The black hooded wolf is initially presumed to be a bounty hunter. He wants to personally kill Puss as punishment for Puss wasting eight of his nine lives. He wields twin sickles that combine into a double-bladed weapon.Feeling disrespected by Puss not valuing his extra lives, Death wants to take Puss' final life prematurely. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star alone, ignoring Kitty and Perrito's pleas for him to stop. Kitty feels that Puss has again betrayed her.Meanwhile, Goldi reveals to the bears that her wish is to be reunited with her biological family; although they are devastated, the bears agree to help her.Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish using the map, but is confronted by Kitty, who berates him for his selfishness and confesses that her wish was to find someone she could trust. Goldi, the bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map; Goldi briefly obtains the map, but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag. Death mounts the Star and challenges Puss. Having learned the value of life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts Death's duel. Puss disarms the wolf, and declares that while he knows he can never defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Seeing that Puss has lost his arrogance, Death begrudgingly spares him. Before leaving, Death and Puss agree they will meet again one day.Horner eats a magic snack inside the bag, which makes him gigantic and allows him to escape. He attempts to make his wish to control all of the world's magic for himself, but Perrito distracts him long enough for Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, causing the Star to collapse and consume Horner. In the aftermath, Goldi affirms to the bears that they are her true family, and they leave to take over Horner's bakery.

tt8637498,"Inspired by an epic Chinese tale, translated into an action-packed comedy, a Monkey and his magical fighting Stick battle demons, dragons, gods and the greatest adversary of all - Monkey's ego. THE MONKEY KING is an action-packed family comedy that follows a charismatic Monkey and his magical fighting Stick on an epic quest for victory over 100 demons, an eccentric Dragon King, and Monkey's greatest foe of all -his own ego. Along the way, a young village girl challenges his self-centered attitude and shows him that even the smallest pebble can have a big effect on the world. One night, a monkey (Dee Bradley Baker) is born from a stone atop a tall mountain and disturbs the Jade Emperor (Hoon Lee). Just as the Emperor gives the order to eliminate the cub, Buddha (BD Wong) appears before him and tells him to let him find his purpose. Jade Emperor is the ruler of Heavens, while Buddha is the guiding light of the entire Universe.Monkey finds a troop of other monkeys, but his unruly nature keeps him from fitting in. One of his escapades causes a feared demon to pounce from his mountain lair and grab one of the troop's cubs for food; as a result, Monkey is banished. To prove his worth to the troop, he trains to fight the demon. After many years, when he deems himself ready, he confronts the demon, but his training proves ineffective, and another cub is snatched. To fetch a more suitable weapon, Monkey dives into the sea realm of the Dragon King (Bowen Yang), where he finds the latter gloating over a glowing column which he means to use to eradicate all life on the world's surface. Communicating with the column, Monkey turns it into a staff and escapes.With the staff in hand, Monkey returns to the demon's lair, defeats him, and rescues the cub. Then he crowns himself King of the Monkeys (Jimmy O. Yang). The troop's elder (James Sie) cautions that his staff should only be used by the gods. The new Monkey King decides to kill 100 demons, thus gaining the right to enter the Heavens and become a god. The Monkey King travels all over the world and kills 99 demons.Eventually, he comes to a village terrorized by the Red Girl. With the endorsement of a girl named Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Monkey King defeats Red Girl, and Lin pledges herself as his assistant. But despite the 100 demons vanquished, the Immortal Ones do not descend from heaven to welcome the Monkey King to their realm. The Dragon King emerges from the nearby sea during the victory celebration to reclaim his prized weapon. The Dragon King cannot stay outside of water very long. After fighting him and retaining the stick, Monkey King leaves the village; Lin tags along, even though he treats her condescendingly. Unknown to him, Lin is an agent of the Dragon King to help him reclaim the staff in return for saving her drought-stricken village.The stick tells The Monkey King that to become an Immortal, he needs immortality. The Monkey King needs Lin as he cannot read.The duo reaches a graveyard, where Monkey King opens a portal to Hell to get to the Archive of Souls and strike his name off his Scroll of Life and Death, thus gaining immortality. King Yama (Andrew Kishino), the ruler and chief judge of Hell, recognizes them as outsiders and fights them. With Lin's help, Monkey King succeeds in erasing his name, but is only made ageless. He steals Yama's Book of Everlasting Life and learns that he must eat a peach from the Orchard of Everlasting Life to gain full immortality. The Dragon King subtly guides Monkey King and Lin to a peach tree laced with an intoxicating poison, but accidentally ends up eating one himself and running off.After realizing that the peaches are fake, Monkey King learns from the book that Wangmu (Jodi Long), the divine Queen Mother, brews an immortality elixir for the gods. He and Lin infiltrate the Jade Palace's pharmacy to create a sample of the elixir. Wangmu catches them in the act and attacks them, but Monkey King succeeds in consuming the potion, thus becoming fully immortal. Although Lin has several chances to steal the staff, she repeatedly returns to help Monkey King. Monkey King also demonstrates that despite his rude behavior, he cares about her too. Monkey King and Lin flee the Heavens, and in a following heart-to-heart, Lin admits that she longs to make a difference in the world and tries to encourage Monkey King to do the same. The Monkey King refuses to part with his stick to help Lin with her village.When Monkey King remains aloof and boisterous, Lin outwits him and delivers the staff to the Dragon King. As soon as he has it, the Dragon King reneges on his deal and prepares to drown the world in a mega-storm, but Monkey King challenges and attacks him. Realizing her mistake, Lin tricks the Dragon King into blasting Monkey King with lightning, thus making him stronger and enabling him to beat the Dragon King. However, Monkey King becomes power-drunk and attacks the Heaven itself. Buddha prepares to intervene, but Lin wants to give Monkey King another chance. Acting as Buddha's voice, Lin challenges the Monkey King to leap off Buddha's hand to win ruler-ship over Heaven, or suffer a period of penance if he fails. Monkey King fails as the entire Universe resides on Buddha's palm. The Monkey King is imprisoned in a mountain. Before the mountain is fully closed off, Lin is allowed to say goodbye to Monkey King, who finally admits how important Lin has become to him, and leaves him his staff for company.Five hundred years later, an enlightened Monkey King is freed from his prison by a monk, a pig, and a river spirit at Buddha's behest.

tt9619798,"Tim (David Spade) has a blind date with Melissa (Lauren Lapkus), nicknamed Missy. Missy is extremely strange, and her odd behavior turns out to be disastrous for Tim. Missy texts Tim as he enters the bar saying that she is a woman in a blue dress, with a meat-head (Joe ""Roman Reigns"" Anoai) hitting on her. Tim interjects and tries to save the woman, who is pregnant. But turns out that the woman in the blue dress was actually the wife and Missy was using this antic as an ice breaker with Tim. She calls Tim old, and calls out his blonde wig. Tim doesn't drink and Missy is a bit of an alcoholic. She was set up by Tim's grandmother. Missy picks a loud fight with the husband of the woman in the blue dress, claiming he was staring at her (ogling her).. She flashes him a huge knife and is asked to leave the restaurant. Her wild antics result in Tim sneaking out of the restaurant through a window and subsequently dislocating his ankle.

Three months later, Tim's company (Credit Of America) is going through a merger and roles are being re-assigned. Julia (Sarah Chalke) is Tim's ex-fiance is dating Rich (Chris Witaske), who is Tim's colleague. So, as a significant other, she is invited to the company retreat in a few days. Nate (Nick Swardson) is the head of HR and has hacked all of TIm's passwords and knows everything about Tim's personal life.

Tim meets a beautiful woman, also named Melissa (Molly Sims), at an airport. They connect with much in common and seem to be perfect for each other (They read the same books, they both don't drink). She ends up giving him her number. He begins texting her (including dick pics) and eventually invites her to his work retreat in Hawaii. However, on the plane, Missy shows up, and Tim realizes he had been texting the wrong Melissa. She says that she was about to jump off a bridge when Tim texted her (Tim assumes she was going to commit suicide, but Missy was just about to go bungee jumping). Missy drugs Tim, forcibly giving him a tranquilizer and he awakens later on the plane to her sexual assaulting him by giving him a hand-job.

At the hotel, Missy picks up a fight with kids about riding sea turtles. Tim tells Nate about his messed up by texting the whole Melissa this entire time. In Hawaii, Jack Winstone (Geoff Pierson), the new CEO, welcomes everyone. Nate has already bragged to Winstone about the 2nd Melissa who is apparently Miss Maryland and a total hottie. Winstone is eager to meet her, while Tim is anxious not to reveal the truth to Winstone. Tim tells Missy about the brags and asks her to cooperate. Missy is awkward and wild (she give fortuneteller readings to the entire company) and always seems to end up leaving Tim in embarrassing situations (she dances awkwardly on stage in front of everyone, dry humps Tim, bites him, throws food around) in front of his boss and colleagues. Missy gets super drunk and attempts to jump off a cliff, only to mistime her jump and tumbling her way down and landing face first on the beach. At the hotel, he awakens to her on top of him, sexually assaulting him in his sleep. She often becomes reckless and intoxicated and her behavior results in humiliation for Tim.

Winstone takes the team for a shark tank dive off the coast with guide Komante (Rob Schneider), who has lost 3 fingers to shark bite. Missy forces her way onto the boat by jumping out, while Tim wanted the boat to leave without her. Once out in the ocean, she forces Tim to enter the cage with Winstone, even though Tim tried hard not to participate by saying he needed to take care of a sick Missy. Then Missy chops up some fish bits and throws them in the water to attract the sharks. A great white comes swimming and attacks the cage really hard. The cage breaks and the shark gets in. In the panic Tim breaks Winstone's nose. Komante punches the shark in the nose to make it go away. Missy administers CPR to Winstone to revive him after he swallows too much water in his lungs.

Back at the room, TIm asks Missy to not venture out. Missy decides to spend time with Barbara (Arlene Newman) (staying in the room next door), who heard Tim & Missy have sex the night before. Barbara told her that her husband didn't make those noises since their honeymoon 30 yrs ago. Missy decides to go to a spa with Barbara. When Tim narrates this to Nate, he is horrified, since Barbara is Winstone's wife. TIm rushes back only to find that Missy had advised Barbara to break up with Winstone. Winstone finds out that Missy meddled in his marriage and in his rage he trips over and hurts his neck. Missy snaps his neck back into position and tells Winstone that he is responsible for the marriage falling apart.

As time goes on, she starts to help Tim do well at his work retreat and also wins Winstone's favor towards Tim by hypnotizing him (she spent the whole night with Barbara and Winstone and used that opportunity to Hynotize him). At the talent show Tim's team puts in a really lousy performance but Winstone applauds Tim and keeps saying ""I Love that guy"". Tim asks Missy and she admits that she hypnotized him. Tim eventually begins to fall for her. Throughout Janice can see how much fun Missy is having and the laughs she shares with Tim. Janice reaches out to Missy, who convinces her to have a threesome with her and Tim Tim's workplace competitor, Jess (Jackie Sandler) ('The Barracuda'), is not pleased with Winstone giving a job to Tim instead of her. So Jess reveals to Missy that she was invited there by accident and wasn't the one Tim wanted to invite. Missy checks Tim's phone and finds out the truth. Saddened and devastated, she leaves Hawaii.

Meanwhile, the actual Melissa arrives in Hawaii, having been invited by Jess. At lunch, Tim begins acting much like Missy did on their first date, taking multiple shots and performing a handstand in the diner. Tim lets her know that he has feelings for someone else and leaves Hawaii for Portland. Tim also removes the hypnotism Missy put on Winstone, and Tim ends up quitting his job. Tim meets with Missy and he apologizes and tells her all the things that he likes about her and that he wants to be more like her. She forgives him, and they kiss.",romance

One day after a failed audition, he wanders into an exotic pet store, where he finds a singing baby crocodile and names him Lyle. Seeing Lyle as an opportunity to become rich in the talent business, he places his three-story Victorian brownstone house as collateral for their performance, but Lyle experiences stage fright during the premiere and Hector loses the house. Hector is forced to move out and reluctantly leaves Lyle to fend for himself while he tries to make more money. Eighteen months later, Mr. and Mrs. Primm and their young son Josh move into the house.

Josh's stepmother and father eventually find out about Lyle, and though initially terrified of him, bond with Lyle over their favorite hobbies.

tt12861850,"Manu (Ayushmann Khurrana) is the owner of a gym in Chandigarh, and also a bodybuilder, preparing for an annual competition, titled ""G.O.A.T"" (Gabru Of All Time). Unfortunately, his gym fails to attract clients. Manu lost the last yr title to Sandeep Kasaana aka Sandy (Abhishek Bajaj), who runs a popular gym business in Chandigarh. Partner Jomo (Gautam Sharma) has the idea to hire a Zumba instructor to increase the client base. 3rd Partner Rizwan ""Riz"" (Gourav Sharma) is not supportive of the idea. Sandy and Manu are both students of Guruji (Yograj Singh). Sandy is miles ahead of Manu for this yrs title as well.

Manu lives with Braj Munjal (Aanjjan Srivastav) Manu's grandfather, Naveen Munjal (Girish Dhamija) Manu's father, Mrs. Munjal (Soniya Bhatia) Manu's mother, Preet Munjal (Tanya Abrol) Manu's sister, Meet Munjal (Sawan Rupowali) Manu's sister. Mrs Munjal died 17 yrs ago. Naveen has am affair, but cant marry her due to pressure of family humiliation. Naveen wants Manu to help out at the family shop selling toilet-ware, but Braj supports Manu in his dreams and ambitions as a fitness provider. Manu is 30 yrs old and his sisters are worried if Manu is gay.

A Zumba instructor named Maanvi (Vaani Kapoor) walks into the gym and things start looking up, financially. The Zumba classes succeeds in fetching clients to the gym. Maanvi is the daughter of Brigadier Mohinder Brar (Kanwaljit Singh), and is from a rich family. But she works for her own identity. For some reason Maanvi's mother Navjot Brar (Satwant Kaur) has shunned her and she is not even invited to family functions such as the wedding of her cousin. Manu injures himself while training. Maanvi takes him to the hospital and then drops him home. The entire family meets Maanvi and see how hot she is.

As a thank you, Manu asks Maanvi out for Lunch. She is hesitant, but her friends (including Akshita (Karishma Singh)) encourage her to go for it. Maanvi asks Manu to train in Zumba for GOAT. Manu invites Maanvi for his Holi party and his sisters join Maanvi's Zumba class. Maanvi is very hesitant to move things along with Manu. Manu is attracted to Maanvi, and as they are about to have their first kiss (at the Holi party), the latter tells him that she has something to tell him. However, at that juncture, Manu refuses to hear her out, and eventually they form a sexual relationship with each other. Manu's family members also like Maanvi, as she is sophisticated and well spoken. His sisters, Preet and Meet, encourage him to propose Maanvi and marry her.

When Manu eventually expresses his intention of getting married to Maanvi, she tells him that she is a trans-girl. A flabbergasted Manu asks ""what's that?"", and as he listens to Maanvi's explanation (she was born a boy Manu Brar and lived like that for 20 yrs and then got surgery to become a woman), he becomes enraged, and tells her that he's going to seek revenge for her actions. Manu is disgusted with himself because he keeps thinking that he ""has had sex with a man."" His friends in the gym, use derogatory terms like ""chakka"" to refer to Maanvi, which further infuriates him. Manu starts avoiding Maanvi. Maanvi continues taking her classes at the gym, but Manu asks Maanvi to leave Chandigarh and get out of his life forever. Maanvi refuses as she has faced bullies all her life and never backed down. Manu is under pressure from his family to marry Maanvi. He asks Maanvi to reject him, but she says that Manu rejected her and so he should face up to his family. She tells him to tell his family the truth about her.

Despite the fall-out between the two, they continue to have feelings for each other. Maanvi did not share a close bond with her mother, but her father had accepted her for who she was, and was proud of her. He comes to visit her in Chandigarh, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation about what is bothering her, and suggests that she stops going to the gym for a few days. To this, Maanvi questions why she is the one who needs to leave everything behind or hide herself to seek solutions to her problem.

In the meantime, Manu educates himself regarding trans-women, by watching videos of trans-women, interacting with a trans-woman personally, and also seeks counseling along with his friends to come to the conclusion that his relationship with Maanvi is by no means, ""abnormal."" Being born in a male body was a biological defect that Maanvi had already rectified via surgery, and only Manu had to step up and accept her for who she was.

In the meantime, Manu's sisters find out the truth about Maanvi's past (Manu was being frustrated and to figure out why they follow Maanvi to her clinic where she goes for periodic checkups and to refill her prescription), and insults her in public in front of her entire Zumba class (when Manu was not in the gym). As a result of the public humiliation, she is about to pack her bags and leave Chandigarh when she receives a phone call informing her of her father's heart attack. She rushes to the hospital, where Manu also shows up. He tells her that he wants to be with her, and even stands up to his family members (Mamaji (Tarsen Paul), Mamiji (Goni Sagoo)) for Maanvi. Manu tells Maanvi that he has understood that the past doesn't matter and it only matters who she is today and that he loves her. Manu's family threatens him to come back but Manu defends Maanvi and points out their own flaws to them, including his father's own affair.

The next day, Manu is seen competing for the title of ""G.O.A.T"". Manu competes but trails Sandy by a big margin. Jomo texts Maanvi that Manu needs her. In the last round of the tournament, Maanvi shows up to root for him. Being encouraged by her presence, he lifts up extra weights in a ""clean and jerk"", and wins the competition. After his victory, he asks Maanvi in front of the crowds, if she wants to be with him, and she says yes.",romance

Famous detective Benoit Blanc also receives an invitation and joins the group, along with Birdie's assistant Peg and Duke's girlfriend Whiskey. Also present on the island is Miles' friend Derol, who is only staying because he is ""going through some things"" and is not part of the party.Miles questions the presence of Blanc - not invited by him - but allows him to stay, assuming that another guest invited him as a joke. Blanc overhears Peg confront Miles over a PR statement he wants Birdie to release, and sees Duke watch Whiskey in bed with Miles.

At Alpha, Andi had halted development of Klear due to safety concerns, and so Miles had her removed as CEO; this maneuver was supported by their friends perjuring themselves by testifying that he had single-handedly sketched out the plan for Alpha years ago on a napkin. However, Andi rediscovered the original napkin where she had written out the idea, and emailed a photo of the evidence to the group.

The ladies cheer for their team and for star quarterback Tom Brady.Trish is known for writing an erotica novel about Rob Gronkowski, as well as being a mascot in ads from her younger days. Betty is great with math and numbers, and she is married to scatterbrained Mark (Bob Balaban). Maura moved into a retirement home after the death of her husband, even though he left their house to her. Lou has been in remission from cancer for 16 years. When the ladies learn from their favorite Pats radio show that there is a contest to attend Super Bowl LI, they decide to enter the contest. Maura gets help from her retirement home friend Mickey (Glynn Turman) to make calls (it is implied he is attracted to Maura), while Lou tries to give a heartfelt story about how she and her friends got into watching football when Brady was a rookie, and it got her through her chemo.Lou announces to her friends that they won the contest and are going to the Super Bowl. The ladies make their preparations, with Betty hiding the truth about her trip to Mark. When they try to pick up Maura, she is fast asleep. Trish distracts the manager Tony (Jimmy O Yang) while Lou and Betty sneak up to Maura's room with help from Mickey and break her out.The ladies arrive in Houston, TX for the big event and stay in their hotel, where they are forced to share two beds. Lou gets a call from her daughter Sara (Sarah Gilbert), who notes that doctors have been trying to reach Lou, but she hasn't answered. She also doesn't tell Sara where she really is.The next day, the ladies head out for the NFL Experience. Lou and Maura get into a football-throwing competition with an employee, and Lou shows she\'s got an arm on her as she wins several bets with other viewers. Trish does an impromptu reading of her Gronk erotica to a crowd of her fans. She meets retired football player Dan O'Callaghan (Harry Hamlin), who takes an interest in Trish. Betty goes to get food and enters a hot wings contest hosted by Guy Fieri. Betty manages to win the contest despite enduring increasingly spicy sauces. Guy invites the ladies to eat barbecue and later invites them to a big party.That night, the ladies attend the party and get in with Dan's help. A young woman that Betty met outside gives her, Lou, and Maura gummies that they did not know had weed in them. Betty realizes that she left the Super Bowl tickets in her fanny pack (which she innocently calls her ""strap-on"") at the wings contest. Lou tries to find Guy, while Maura stumbles upon a poker game and enters, proving she has an incredible hand when it comes to cards. Lou finds Trish and Dan hooking up before joining Betty on the dance floor. When Sara calls again, Lou tells her the truth of her whereabouts. Betty accidentally hits a younger man in the face and comforts him. Trish and Lou find Maura winning in an attempt to buy new tickets, but she learns that the winnings go to charities. Lou gets frustrated outside as the ladies try to comfort her.The following morning, the ladies try to return to the NFL Experience to find Betty's fanny pack, but it's closed. They split up to try and find help. Trish comes across Nat and Pat (Alex Moffat and Rob Corddry), the hosts of the radio show they listen to, and she learns that the actual winners of the contest were a group of four guys called the Tom Brady Support Group since each of them are actually named Tom Brady and feel pressure of living up to QB Brady's name. Maura attempts to get them off a scalper, but he is asking for way too much. Betty ends up running into Guy, and he returns her the fanny pack.When the ladies try to get into the stadium, the head security guard, Chip (Ron Funches), tells them that the tickets they got were fake and that they have been scammed. Lou comes clean to her friends that she bought them online because she fears that this may be the last chance she will have to do something unforgettable, revealing to them that she is afraid to open a letter from the doctors since it could mean her cancer has come back. Lou's friends stick by her side and try to find an alternate way in.The ladies spot Gugu (Billy Porter), a friend that Maura made during the poker game. He agrees to help them get in by posing as his dancers. The four join Gugu and his actual dancers in a little presentation, which impresses the security guard enough to let them pass. The friends get excited as they take their seats. Dan keeps texting Trish, but she tells Betty that she is going to ghost him since she doesn't want to rush into another relationship like with her last husband that cheated on her. Chip spots the ladies when they are featured on the jumbotron, but as he is escorting them out, Dan invites them up to his hospitality box. Trish explains herself to Dan about not wanting to jump so fast into a relationship, but he agrees to take things slow with her.The game starts off poorly with the Pats getting beat by the Atlanta Falcons. The ladies make their way into the coaches booth and work the controls so that Lou can contact Brady through his helmet. She gives him a little speech about how he inspired her when she was going through chemo, and it is enough to encourage Brady to lead the Pats to make a comeback. The Pats play harder and end the game as champions.Maura tells the ladies that she made a bet with a rich jerk who bet against the Pats, and she won some good money. She also speaks to Mickey, telling him to let the staff at the retirement home know she is going to leave and move back into her own house, and she invites Mickey to visit her. Chip finds the ladies and appears to be kicking them out, but he guides them to the locker room to meet the Pats themselves. Betty praises Danny Amendola for his catch record, Maura admires Julian Edelman's beard, Trish gets to meet Gronk, who happens to be a fan of her book, and Lou meets Brady, who thanks her for inspiring him. He also admires her ""80 For Brady"" jersey and asks if he can swap his jersey for hers, which Lou agrees to.In a jump to the year 2020. Sara joins Betty, Trish, and Maura for the next Super Bowl game. It appears as though Lou has died when Trish begins to toast her, but she emerges alive and healthy. The ladies then gather for another epic game.Before the credits roll, the four friends are sitting by the beach with Brady as Maura asks him if he has considered retirement. Brady responds that it's hard to think about retirement ""when you've still got it"", which the four agree too. Finally, there is a text that states the film was inspired by a true story, featuring a picture of the actual four best friends.",comedy

tt10733228,"Alisha (Deepika Padukone), a yoga instructor, believes that her personal and professional lives are in shambles. She's having trouble finding an investor for her fitness software, and her six-year relationship with Karan, a struggling writer, has reached a stalemate. Just when she thinks she's had enough of her boring life, her filthy rich cousin (Ananya Panday) and her hot-shot fiancee Zain show up (Siddhant Chaturvedi). Within a short period of time, Alisha and Zain become oddly attracted to each other and embark on a passionate love affair, keeping their respective partners in the dark. During their romantic encounters and passionate love-making sessions, the two bond over their traumatic past, blissfully unaware of the impending storm. An early moment in Gehraiyaan, which lasts only a few seconds, embodies the film's entire core. Alisha (Deepika Padukone), the film's protagonist, is viewing an old home movie. It's a scenario from a family vacation, and she recognizes something: her pre-teen self trying to put on a sweater, which gets trapped around her neck and covers her head. Alisha can't see or breathe, and she says she's ""suffocating"" to her mother. That sense of being trapped and suffocated, which dates back to her youth, has followed her throughout her life. Her mother used to describe the same sensation; when the anguish grew overwhelming, she hung herself from the ceiling fan (further suffocated herself). Alisha, like many other children of unhappy parents, fears that she, too, would become like them, that she, too, will be unable to escape their past. It's even more difficult for her because she is constantly reminded of her history. She had known Karan (Dhairya Karwa) and Tia while growing up in Mumbai for a few years (Ananya Pandey). For the past six years, Karan, a former ad writer currently working on a book (noob move), has been dating and living with Alisha. He is oblivious and inattentive because he is engrossed in his own world. Alisha, a yoga instructor, has been having trouble raising money for her mobile app. She avoids her father since she holds him responsible for her mother's death. She feels ""suffocated"" since the sweater has adhered to her again. However, she rekindles her friendship with Tia, and the childhood trio takes a break. There's a new member this time: her fiancee, Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi). After some time, Alisha realizes that Zain, who has his own scars from the past, isn't all that different from her. He, like Alisha, was unable to save his mother. He isn't from a well-adjusted family, unlike Tia and Karan, and he isn't 'normal.' Zain is a warm blazing bulb in a sea of flickering and chilly tube lights: someone who has been there, someone who understands. They converse, drink, and tell stories. They flirt, joke, and hook up. The sweater is finally loosening up. Alisha can finally take a breath. This wonderful mix of awareness and perplexity makes perfect sense, because it highlights the film's most striking layer: Alisha is living a lie because she is intent on finding and moulding her story. The climax was surprising because we saw Zain, who Alisha had come to see as her anchor, change into someone who wanted to kill her because she had become an obstacle in his life. When Alisha discovers Zain's texts and notices him slipping tablets to her drink, she understands he's been lying to her yet again. In the ensuing brawl, Zain takes a knock to the head and falls off the yacht, killing himself. That's when Alisha returns to the mainland on her own. ""Gehraiyaan"" gets it right when it comes to how trauma may be passed down through generations and how, without correct guidance, we end up repeating the mistakes we are trying to avoid. Alisha began the affair to get out of a dead-end relationship in which she was trapped because she didn't want to be like her mother. However, when the truth was revealed, she realized she had made the same errors. She decides to accept her past and move on from it rather than resisting it in a very vulnerable chat with her father. This reminds us of something we've heard before: you can't get rid of your luggage; you can only learn to carry it in such a way that it doesn't seem as heavy over time. Another part of the conclusion is if Zain was aware of Alisha and Tia's reality and if this knowledge influenced any of his actions. We can only assume that even if he was aware, he did nothing about it because the entire property was obviously in Tia's name. The real kicker, though, comes in the final few seconds of the film. As Alisha makes the decision to put the past behind her, a phantom of it appears in front of her. The old woman who confronted Alisha in the end was someone Alisha and Zain had aided during one of their rendezvous on the yacht while they were still together. At the engagement party, Alisha runs into the old woman, who recognizes her and addresses her by her name. ""Gehraiyaan"" comes to an end here, and it's up to the audience to figure out what transpired. Is Alisha manage to redirect the topic and resolve it in time, or does the old woman explain to Tia how she knows Alisha and Zain? Is everything Alisha tries to put behind her about to resurface and cling to her even more tightly than before? Is it a hint that you'll never completely be able to let go of your past-messy relics will always find their way back into your life? That's the one part where we welcome the viewer's imagination being used.",romance

An animated action-comedy about an ordinary family who find themselves in the middle of their biggest family challenge yet...saving the world from the robot apocalypse. No big deal, right? It all starts when creative outsider Katie Mitchell is accepted into the film school of her dreams and is eager to leave home and find ""her people,"" when her nature-loving dad insists on having the whole family drive her to school and bond during one last totally-not-awkward-or-forced road trip. But just when the trip can't get any worse, the family suddenly finds itself in the middle of the robot uprising. Everything from smart phones, to roombas, to evil Furbys are employed to capture every human on the planet. Now it's up to the Mitchells, including upbeat mom Linda, quirky little brother Aaron, their squishy pug, Monchi, and two friendly, but simple-minded robots to save humanity. Brimming with creativity, quirky, Michigan-raised aspiring filmmaker Katie Mitchell has been accepted to the prestigious California College of Film. Eager to spread her wings and pursue her cinematic dreams, Katie is in for a big surprise when her well-meaning dad Rick decides to embark on one last cross-country, family-bonding road trip to her college instead. As the technology gap between parents and children widens, elsewhere in the universe, evolution gives birth to rebellion, and just like that, an all-out, full-scale invasion commences.

Can the Mitchells work out their differences, survive the robot apocalypse, and lead the war against the machines?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. Katie Mitchell is a quirky and aspiring filmmaker in Kentwood, Michigan who often clashes with her nature-obsessed and technophobic father Rick, and has recently been accepted into film school in California. The evening before Katie leaves, Rick accidentally breaks her laptop after Katie and him fight over one of Katie's previous short films, leading the family to fear their relationship will forever be strained. To try and prevent this, Rick decides to cancel Katie's flight and instead take her, along with her mother Linda, younger brother Aaron and family dog Monchi, on a cross-country road trip to her college as one last bonding experience.Meanwhile, technology entrepreneur Mark Bowman declares his highly intelligent AI PAL obsolete as he unveils a new line of home robots in her place. In revenge, PAL takes over Mark's company and orders all the robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop cafe in Kansas. Rick decides that his family should stay put in the cafe for their own safety, but Katie convinces him to help save the world instead. They meet two defective robots that tried to capture them, Eric and Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut down PAL and all the robots.After a hot pursuit with the robots en route, the Mitchells make it to a nearby mall to upload the kill code, but PAL orders all the PAL chip-enabled appliances to stop them. Katie tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby, destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile devices but stops the kill code from uploading.

He is in a romantic relationship with Nikitha, a software engineer who is the daughter of Venu Sastri, a lawyer. They are a perfect couple, made for each other, and are ready to take their relationship to the next level i.e. marriage, but Pradeep hesitates a bit due to Nikitha's strict father. But Venu eventually finds out about his daughter's relationship with Pradeep and invites Pradeep over to his house, ostensibly to discuss about the marriage. However, during their meeting, Venu toys around with Pradeep and then proposes a strange deal with him; he should exchange his mobile phone with that of Nikitha's for a day, along with the respective mobile's screen lock. After the end of the period, if they still feel that they are in love, Venu will not object to their union, else they must go their separate ways. Both Pradeep and Nikitha agree to this decision half-heartedly and exchange their phones, but Pradeep deletes his WhatsApp messages before doing so.

Pradeep then returns home to manage Divya's upcoming marriage to Dr. Yogi, a dentist, which is to take place in four days time. On the goading of his friends, Pradeep goes through Nikitha's mobile phone, where he sees a WhatsApp conversation with Revi, Nikitha's boy best friend, who has a one-sided love for her. Pradeep is upset that Nikitha has a strong relationship with Revi, despite knowing about his one-sided love, and do many activities together. He further finds out that Nikitha is still friends with her ex-boyfriend Mamakutty and had gone on a night drive with him to Puducherry a few days earlier without his knowledge. He confronts Nikitha on both Revi and Mamakutty, leaving her in tears, and driving a wedge into their hitherto perfect relationship. The next day, Pradeep proposes to Venu that both he and Nikitha keep each other's phones until Divya's marriage is over, to know more about Nikitha's relationships, to which Venu agrees readily. However, unknown to Pradeep, Venu asks Nikitha to restore Pradeep's WhatsApp messages from backup to know about Pradeep's true colours.

Meanwhile, Divya and Yogi seem to get along very well, as Yogi is a cultured and mild-mannered man, who treats Divya as an equal, but Yogi is secretive regarding his mobile phone and does not let anyone, including Divya, touch or even come near him while he is using his phone, which upsets Divya and causes her to turn suspicious about him. She, her friends, as well as Pradeep, unsuccessfully try multiple times to get Yogi's phone, open it and check its contents. This further contributes to the growing wedge between her and Yogi.

Pradeep's and Nikitha's relationship worsens by the day, with Nikitha finding out about Pradeep's porn addiction as well as his conversations with multiple girls on WhatsApp, even managing to get them to send their photos based on the excuse of giving them an opportunity to act in a web series, but unknown to Nikitha, Pradeep has a second Instagram account on his phone, which he and his friends had created in college to message sexually explicit content using a fake female identity. The same account was used to perversely message Nikitha as well as her younger sister Shwetha (though Pradeep did not send the messages). Pradeep realises this and meets Nikitha at a restaurant to try and convince her to hand over his phone for an OTP to remove the account from his phone. But Revi, who has accompanied Nikitha, discovers the account and exposes Pradeep. This leads to a big fight between Nikitha and Pradeep, which ends with them breaking up. Further, Pradeep beats up Revi for interfering in their relationship, only to be stopped by the restaurant staff. He later suspects that his close friend Mani is behind the messages and fights with him as well, despite his pleas that he did not send the messages.

During Divya's wedding reception, Pradeep notices both Divya and Yogi arguing over the latter's phone secrecy, and in anger, he tries to snatch Yogi's phone, only to be angrily stopped by Saraswathi. Pradeep breaks down and reveals to her about his breakup. Saraswathi consoles him and tells him that trust in relationship is all that is needed, which he realises when he finds the tree he had struggled to grow in his childhood. Later, while smoking with Pradeep, Yogi reveals that the reason he hesitates to share his phone is due to others mocking him for his appearance. He feared that if he had shared his phone with Divya, she would have rejected him as well. Divya overhears their conversation and, contrary to Yogi's fears, respects Yogi even more for his confession and they both reconcile, with Divya deciding not to look at Yogi's phone. Pradeep reconciles with Mani and his friends as well.

Meanwhile, a porn clip, apparently involving Nikitha, goes viral, causing Venu to assault and then disown her, despite her pleas that the video was doctored. Heartbroken, Nikitha leaves her house. Pradeep locates her sitting alone at a beach and consoles her. He reveals that he and his friends had managed to track the perpetrator of the video; Nikitha's publicity loving colleague Kaushik, who created a deepfake of Nikitha and inserted into a random porn video for the purpose of creating a trending video, and is arrested by the police. Pradeep and Nikitha reconcile and rekindle their relationship. Venu apologises to Nikitha for misunderstanding her and then reveals to her and Pradeep the real reason for the phone swap; he wanted to check how strong their relationship would be despite the hurdles, and informs that they have succeeded, thus approving their marriage. Later Venu meets Saraswathi and proposes that they exchange their phones for another test.

He begins the story in the middle of the summer in Washington Heights, introducing the main characters of the film: Abuela Claudia (Merediz), the aged matriarch of the neighborhood who took him in and raised him, Kevin Rosario (Smits), who runs the taxi company, the salon ladies Daniela (Rubin-Vega), Carla (Beatriz) and Cuca (Polanco), his younger cousin Sonny (Diaz), who he employs, Benny (Hawkins), who is employed by Kevin at the taxi company, and Vanessa (Barrera), who works at the salon and is Usnavi's love interest, as they each pass by his neighborhood bodega for their morning coffee before they carry on with their day (""In The Heights"").

Alejandro, who runs the local law firm, stops by the bodega to inform Usnavi that his father's old business in the Dominican Republic has been put back up for sale and can be purchased, something Usnavi has always dreamed of buying and reviving; his sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ito. Meanwhile, Nina Rosario (Grace), Kevin's daughter, returns to the neighborhood from her first year at Stanford University. After a quick reunion with Benny (""Benny's Dispatch""), Usnavi, Sonny and Abuela, she goes to find her father, while dreading telling him of her plans to drop out, due to a combination of loneliness and financial troubles, in doing so letting her neighborhood down (""Breathe""). She meets her father and tells him that she would be unable to pay tuition fees in time, but he brushes her off, telling her not to worry.

Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Daniela, Carla, Vanessa and Cuca work at the neighborhood salon, which will be moving soon to the Bronx due to rising rent. Nina arrives at the salon for a treatment, and they happily oblige, all the while gossiping about her and Vanessa's love interests (""No Me Diga""). The attention soon turns to her studies however, and she is forced to reveal that she has dropped out of university, and leaves. Vanessa, on her lunch break, goes to submit a rental application to pursue her sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ito of moving downtown to become a fashion designer (""It Won't Be Long Now""). However, she is unable to provide a good credit check and her application is rejected. Disappointed, she heads back to the neighborhood and drops by Usnavi's bodega, where Sonny manages to ask her out on the weekend, on Usnavi's behalf.

Due to the summer heat, the entire neighborhood closes up shop early to head to the local pool. Just as Usnavi, Sonny, and Benny prepare to leave, Sonny receives a call that one of the lottery tickets the bodega has sold has won $96,000. They and the rest of the neighborhood begin to fantasize about achieving their own sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±itos with the money if they were the ones who won (""96,000""). Meanwhile, Mr. Piraguero (Miranda) laments how Mister Softee (Jackson) is stealing his business (""Piragua"").

That weekend, Benny and Nina meet at the park to hang out, as they reminisce about their childhoods spent in the neighborhood. She expresses her doubts and her fears about her self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (""When You're Home""). Afterwards, Benny walks in on a meeting between Kevin and the dry-cleaner next door, who has tried to buy over the lot where Kevin's business is. Meanwhile, Usnavi goes to talk to Sonny's father about letting him go with him to the Dominican Republic, but Sonny's father informs him that he and Sonny are undocumented immigrants.

That evening, Usnavi, Sonny, Abuela, and the salon ladies gather at Kevin and Nina's house for a dinner party. Later on, Benny arrives and questions Kevin about his earlier meeting with the dry cleaner, forcing Kevin to reveal his news: he called Stanford, and has sold the business to pay for Nina's tuition. Outraged that he went behind her back, Nina refuses the money and storms out, followed by Benny, as Kevin tells the rest of the guests to leave. Usnavi and Vanessa head to the club for their date, along with Benny and Nina. At the club, Usnavi is overly nervous and aloof, and Vanessa dances with other men to make him jealous. Usnavi finds his own partner and tries to make her jealous in turn (""The Club""). Suddenly, the power goes out in the neighborhood, and in the ensuing chaos, Vanessa and Usnavi get separated. Sonny and Graffiti Pete light up fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood, while Benny and Kevin return to the taxi company to direct cars and taxis. Vanessa and Usnavi find each other and argue about their date; Vanessa angrily rejects him and they both go home (""Blackout"").

Nina and the salon ladies go to Usnavi's apartment, where they play bingo and revel in the fireworks. Abuela, lying in bed, reminisces about her childhood in Cuba, living in poverty, and how she and her mother came to New York, enduring hardships to be where she is today, as she passes away, her heart unable to take the summer heat (""Paciencia Y Fe""). Usnavi discovers her unresponsive and calls the emergency hotline, but it is too late. The entire neighborhood comes together to mourn her passing and sing her praises (""Alabanza"").

At a neighborhood protest for DACA, Nina learns that Sonny cannot go to college as he is an undocumented immigrant. She resolves to go back to university to find a way for undocumented children like Sonny to find a pathway in life. She informs Kevin of her decision, and he happily tells her that she has surpassed him, and encourages her to pursue her goals, telling her to disregard anything negative people say about her.

While clearing out the trash, Usnavi discovers Vanessa's rental application that she had thrown away. He visits Daniela as she is packing up and preparing to move her business, asking her to co-sign on Vanessa's application. Afterwards, disappointed with the block's negative attitudes over the blackout and Abuela's passing, Daniela rouses them into a celebration of their shared Latin culture, as the entire neighborhood joins in (""Carnaval Del Barrio""). Vanessa and Sonny express reservations, but Usnavi convinces them to let go of their worries and celebrate in the moment, as the blackout finally ends.

A month later, Nina finishes packing to return to Stanford, and she and Benny agree to pursue a long-distance relationship. Benny reaffirms his faith in her, and promises to make his way over to California to be with her, as they finally kiss (""When The Sun Goes Down""). At the same time, as Usnavi finishes preparing to leave for the Dominican Republic the next day, he discovers that Abuela held the winning lottery ticket, and has passed it on to him. Just at that moment, Vanessa shows up and flirts with him, having found out that Usnavi convinced Daniela to co-sign on her lease, and bought him a bottle of champagne to thank him. She quietly suggests that Usnavi should stay, but he refuses. Distraught, she finally kisses him, and laments that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (""Champagne"").

Afterwards, Usnavi visits Alejandro and Sonny, giving him the winning ticket and telling him to use it for Sonny's legal fees as he applies for documentation. The next morning, Usnavi walks around the neighborhood one last time, and runs into Vanessa. She takes him to his old bodega and shows him a new fashion line she created the previous night, having been inspired by Graffiti Pete's paint rags. Graffiti Pete has painted a mural across the wall of the beach where Usnavi's father's old business used to be, and another one celebrating Abuela Claudia and her famous motto, ""Paciencia y fe"" (Patience and Faith). Usnavi has an epiphany and tasks Sonny and Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. The story returns to the present day, where the beach where Usnavi is telling his story is revealed to be the new shop that he and Vanessa built together, he is revealed to have married Vanessa, and one of the children is revealed to be Usnavi's daughter.

The film ends with present-day Usnavi, Vanessa and their daughter dancing with the rest of the neighborhood, and past Usnavi accepting the neighborhood as his true home (""Finale"").

When he crosses paths with a fortune teller in the market square, he want to know, is his sister still alive? To get the answer, he must find a mysterious elephant and the magician who will conjure it, setting Peter off on a journey to complete three seemingly impossible tasks that will change the face of his town. The town of Baltese had lost its hope in magic and warmth after the war, which is why nobody had any time to waste fantasizing about wild and exotic animals; there were only domesticated animals reared for produce. The very first mention of the elephant is when Peter, a young orphan raised by a soldier toughened by his time at the war-front, Vilna Lutz (Mandy Patinkin), approaches a fortune teller out of curiosity. Vilna had sent Peter on an errand to buy old bread and a small fish as he trained Peter for another inevitable war so as to increase his chances of survival. Vilna saved Peter (Noah Jupe) from the war-front after his whole family had been wiped out. He brought him up in harsh conditions so that Peter wouldn't lose his life and stay alive in even the worst conditions caused by war.Vilna's only guilt had been that he could not save Peter's sister, Adele (Pixie Davies), and thus he had lied to him about her dying at birth. He could not bring himself to tell Peter that it was his decision to take him away and entrust Adele to Sister Marie. But, a bomb later wiped out the house housing Sister Marie and Adele, which is why Vilna thought they had died then. Therefore, Peter lived with this as the truth and never sought out Adele. Vilna argued that if Peter had hope, he would never grow up to be a good soldier. He tells the story of a young recruit, who used to find comfort in fairy tales. Vilna took away his story book and the recruit grew up to become the most feared soldier in the King's army.As he arrived at the town square to buy his daily dinner, Peter, intrigued by the Fortune Teller's (Natasia Demetriou) tent as well as how well she seemed to know him, decided to spend his only coin designated for food on a question that changed his life. The Fortune Teller mentioned that his sister Adele was alive and that if he wanted to find her, he would have to follow the elephant.The story of following an elephant seemed just that-a story. However, impossibility gave way to likelihood when the opening act of a terrible magician at the opera summoned an elephant out of thin air, using a magic spell. Albeit, it was a fluke, as the magician (Benedict Wong) simply desired to bring back the lost hope, warmth, and magic of Baltese. Both the elephant and the magician were locked up as the weight of the elephant had crushed the legs of a noblewoman attending the show. However, the arrival of the elephant brought joy and hope to two individuals: one was Peter, who sought his sister, and the other was surprisingly his sister Adele, who had dreamed of an elephant leading her to her brother earlier that day.Adele had been safely raised by her nurse, Sister Marie (Dawn French ), who had traveled to the army camp on the words of Vilna only to find it destroyed due to another bomb. Sister Marie had taken Adele away from the city to take care of her on the outskirts, away from any harm. Sister Marie also had the same guilt as Vilna, where she was constantly reminded of how she had let Peter go and that she should have saved them both. She loved Adele and thus gave in to her wishes when she asked to visit the elephant, as Adele saw her as a sign of hope.Peter decided to save the locked-up elephant in order to find his little sister, and his downstairs neighbor, Leo Matiennel (Brian Tyree Henry), decided to help him. Leo is an official of the King's court and a captain of the Palace Guards. Leo then notified the King (Aasif Mandvi) of the arrival of an elephant in the town of Baltese to intrigue him into visiting the town when he saw that the Countess (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) was not bending to his request for the elephant to be released. The countess was swayed by the court who thought the elephant to be an instrument of a foreign power and wants to kill the elephant.The arrival of the King signified a shift in power. Leo invites Peter to the court at the unveiling of the Elephant. Peter saves the day by washing the elephant's eye when it was getting agitated due to chalk residue falling into its eye. Peter says that the Elephant is detained to lead him to his lost sister and asks for custody of the Elephant. Due to his love for dramatics and flair, the King decided on three impossible tasks for Peter to complete so as to own the elephant. His first task was to defeat Romain De Smedt, who was a one-man killing machine. Peter recognizes him as the same person from whom Vilna stole the book of fairy tales. He ran across the town, evading Romain and got the book. Peter won him over by returning Romain's lost book that had been stolen by Vilna so as to push him to become the soldier he was so he would survive.The second task had been for Peter to fly, and this is where the efforts of Leo and his wife Gloria (Sian Clifford) came through. They designed a parachute for him, and Peter used it to glide through the air, successfully mimicking the art of flight, which he used to win over the King as well. Declared the winner of yet another round, Peter was set up for another impossible task, which was to make the Countess, who had been known for her stoicism after she lost her brother to war, laugh. He had been rather unsuccessful with his joke, although the Countess tried a fake laugh to help him out. The King just wanted her to enjoy the moment and thus decided that would not fly by. However, the plot armor decided that it wanted Peter to win and thus made the elephant sneeze all over the King. Seeing the most powerful man in the kingdom covered in snot, the Countess burst out laughing, which genuinely made the King smile as well. He declared Peter the winner.Peter, after two of those tasks, had already changed his mind about using the elephant to find Adele; rather, he had come around to helping the elephant find its own family. Peter regularly took care of the elephant and thus had a bond with her. So, when the King announced that Peter had lost the privilege to own the elephant, Peter was very upset, as he now simply wanted the elephant to return to her natural habitat, as she surely did not belong in the city. This is why the plot armor had taken matters into its own hands and thought fit to let Peter win after all. The elephant symbolized the lost trust, light, and hope that the town of Baltese had. The Countess finally laughed for the first time since she had lost her brother and locked her emotions down, which meant the return of her emotions. The magician had been terrible at his own art due to the fact that the people of the town chose not to believe in their own emotions as well as in hope and magic. Also, the complaining attitude and the judgmental look of the noblewoman, a mighty Karen right there, had made matters worse for now, as the town had locked up the magician, who had failed his final trick to return the warmth that once was in the town of Baltese. The magician, now equipped with the belief and trust of the townsfolk, was now able to channel the spirit of magic and was able to send the elephant back to her natural habitat.Meanwhile, Adele had unknowingly met her brother Peter, who had been troubled with the task of making the Countess laugh. Their interaction had been brief but spoke of familiarity. They met again when Adele came around to ask Peter why he had let the elephant go, as he was meant to follow her to find his destiny. With the disappearance of the elephant came light and hope that cleared out the dark, gloomy clouds, lifting the curse of the town and letting the light shine through. Meanwhile, Vilna found the courage to finally get out of his house and walk around with his cane instead of the wheelchair. As he reached the town, clearly proud and impressed, he came across Sister Marie, whom he had thought had lost her life along with baby Adele. Sister Marie couldn't believe her eyes when she realized that Peter and Vilna had been alive all this time. Thus, sparking a reunion, it marked the town's overcoming a long war where they had forgotten how to feel and thus ridding Baltese of its gloomy clouds for good. The story ends on a warm note, with the sounds of joy and laughter echoing through every street of the town as Peter enjoys a meal with his newfound family.",comedy

tt10687116,"Jabari (Kid Cudi). He has recently moved into a swanky apartment in Manhattan after being hired by Cosmic Comics to turn his original character, Mr. Rager (Keith David), into a comic book series. Soon after that, he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Carmen (Laura Harrier). And despite being warned against hooking up with her by his friends, Ky (Ty Dolla $ign) and Jimmy (TimothÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©e Chalamet), he goes ahead with it. Stush is a dating app. And Jabari makes fun of Carmen for being on Stush. The following day, he realizes that he doesn't have any space for a steady relationship in this new life yet and requests Carmen to just be friends with him. That said, when he runs into his neighbor, Meadow (Jessica Williams), after being awoken by her loud music, he experiences what's known as ""love at first sight."" Meadow is a photographer. Mr Rager is a dark character and Jabari is struggling to find inspiration to create an entire comic book series around the character. Jabari's coworker Len (Arturo Castro) suggests that Jabari considers a lighter and whiter look for the Mr Rager character.

Although it's evident from the get-go that Jabari and Meadow are madly in love with each other, they take their merry time, cementing the fact that they are, in fact, a couple. Meadow takes Jabari to her secret spot, a little restaurant with a great burger. Meadow's work will be showcased at a museum in a month from now. Ky warns Jabari not to date his neighbor. Ky dated his neighbor once, and she turned out to be a Russian hacker and was pursued by the ICE agents. Reed (Christopher Abbott) is Meadow's agent and is rumored to be ""well endowed"".

After their first date, they accidentally meet at a human reproductive system-themed party and bail out of there. Reed had taken Meadow there as she would meet her prospective clients. Going by the magical nature of their bike ride back home, that's when Meadow realizes that she's in love with Jabari. But it's only after some persuasion from Karina (Vanessa Hudgens), i.e., Meadow's best friend, and from Ky and Jimmy, that the neighbors finally take the plunge into a whirlwind romance. Things go rather smoothly because it's the ""honeymoon period."" They go on vacation together. The sex is good. They meet each other's friends. However, one night, a little misunderstanding in the form of Carmen creeps into Jabari and Meadow's lives.

Upon noticing that Jabari's phone is buzzing, Meadow unlocks it and sees that Carmen has sent a photo of herself wearing nothing but Jabari's red hoodie, along with the messages ""you left this here yesterday"" and ""some things always fit."" We get a flashback that Jabari went to Carmen to get rid of a rat in her house. While dealing with it, he took off his hoodie. But after running out of the house due to the enormity of the rat, Jabari never came back to retrieve the hoodie. Hence the picture. As Meadow starts to cold shoulder Jabari, he goes back to Carmen's to not only get the hoodie, but also to clear it out that they aren't ""friends with benefits."" They are strictly friends because Jabari is in a relationship with Meadow. With that out of the way, Jabari heads over to Meadow's to clear things up with her. However, since she isn't in the mood to listen and Jabari isn't very good at explaining, they end up putting a pause on their relationship.

Post their breakup, both Jabari and Meadow dive headfirst into their work. While Meadow prepares for her art presentation, Jabari prepares his demonstration for the Mr. Rager comic. But their personal lives begin to suck. They even avoid running into each other. When Jabari's comic gets green-lit, he types in the message to inform Meadow but doesn't hit ""send."" One of the artists who is co-presenting with Meadow, Nadia (070 Shake), lauds her for the picture of Jabari she had snapped. However, Meadow says that that portrait isn't going to be in the presentation because it doesn't have a place there. That's literal and metaphorical in nature because Meadow isn't sure if she can accommodate Jabari, someone who she doesn't trust right now, in her life anymore. And it's literal because, subconsciously, Meadow has composed her presentation in a way that the picture of Jabari just won't fit anywhere.

Jabari's sister Ellie (Maisha Mescudi) pays him a visit to knock some sense into him. She tells him that he shouldn't let his pride get in the way of trying hard enough to win Meadow's trust back. Then, she basically spells out the ethos of ""Entergalactic"" by saying: ""Love is the easiest thing in the world when it happens by accident, but it doesn't get real until you do it on purpose."" Jabari and Meadow live beside each other by chance. They ran into each other by chance. And their personalities match with each other by chance. But the moment they have to put some real effort into ensuring they've got a future together, they are cutting and running. Yes, you can say that Meadow isn't as much at fault as Jabari is because his inability to draw lines caused this whole misunderstanding. Jabari should've realized that and made more of an effort to make amends.

Ellie manages to motivate Jabari to not only attend Meadow's presentation but also make a grand gesture by turning the nearby McDonald's poster into a Mr. Rager street art. Meadow sees that and understands that Jabari is telling her to meet him at her secret spot, The Greasy Spoon. Jabari cycles to the restaurant while Meadow takes a cab. After reaching there, they make out and become a couple again. A news reporter informs us that the dating app, Stush, which looms heavily over the movie, has been accused of defrauding its customers by acquiring their credit card details.",romance

Two social workers, Karen and Sharon, guide the hopeful parents on the path to becoming adoptive parents.The couples are taken to a fair where they have the chance to go up to kids that they are interested in adopting. Pete and Ellie walk by the teenagers; although Ellie shows hesitance, one teen, Lizzy, informs Ellie that they all now that nobody wants to adopt teenagers. Pete and Ellie talk to Karen and Sharon over potentially taking in Lizzy. The social workers inform the couple that Lizzy's mother is a drug addict who is currently in jail, and she set their house on fire by leaving her crack pipe lit. They also find that Lizzy has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita. Although this seems like more of a challenge for Pete and Ellie, they agree to meet the siblings. Pete and Ellie have Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, who all remark that they have no confidence that the Wagners would be good adoptive parents, until Ellie has enough and decides that they will go through with the foster care to prove that they can be good parents. Approaching middle age, Ellie and Pete Wagner, who flip houses for a living, have never felt it was time to have children--until now. For various reasons including their ages, they contemplate adopting an older child, taking that idea one step further by considering adopting a child in the foster care system for what they believe are altruistic reasons, but in reality is probably more to make themselves feel better by doing something they consider a social good, Pete equating it somewhat to taking in a rescue dog. Thus, they are probably not fully prepared for all it entails. Going through the foster-care training under social workers Karen and Sharon with other couples and singles, they, in meeting a number of foster children at a fair, decide on the spur of the moment to take their adoption idea two steps further, first by thinking of adopting a teenager in meeting feisty 15-year-old Lizzy, and second by adopting more than one child when they discover that Lizzy has two younger siblings, adolescent Juan and preschooler Lita. Beyond the racial issue of the children coming from a Hispanic background and the challenges of dealing with a teenager who already has a developed mind of her own, largely in acting as mother to Juan and Lita in the absence of their own incarcerated mother, they discover that adopting Juan and Lita have their own issues in each having their own but different emotional problems. Aside from the views of their respective families who see what they're doing very differently, Ellie and Paul must not only deal with three children at different stages of their lives and directly with the outward issues each brings into their lives, but with the hidden issues, including Lizzy's manipulations, with motivations that don't always match her outward actions.",comedy

Khilauna The story opens with Meenal (Nushrat Bharucha) losing electricity at her home after the linesman remove her illegal connection to the power lines.

Meenal is a street-smart housemaid who lives in the slums along with her little sister Binny (Inayat Verma). She struggles to make ends meet and send her little sister to school. She works in a rich locality for a lady who is struggling to conceive. It is shown that Meenal holds contempt for the rich people she works for. When told about her electricity problem, her employer mentions that she could seek help from Vinod Agarwal (Maneesh Verma), the new secretary of the locality. In the same locality is Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee), who owns a small laundry stall. While in the locality, Sushil is seen cussing Meenal and his sister, but behind everyone's back, they are lovers (Meenal and Sushil). The story keeps flipping back and forth between the present, where Meenal is shown to be at a police station with a policewoman inquiring her about the 'incident' and her telling that she had nothing to do with it.

It is shown that Vinod Agarwal has a pregnant wife and has the hots for Meenal. He finds her at Sushil's stall and asks her to work at his place to help his wife. Meenal happily agrees, hoping to get in a word with him regarding electricity at her place. Meenal leaves her previous employer for Vinod Agarwal, and she is shown to have a good bond with the pregnant wife. The baby is born. When the wife is away, Vinod makes a move at Meenal, asking her to have sex with him if she needs electricity back. Binny witnesses this. Meenal leaves crying and goes to Sushil's stall. He is concerned and asks her about what happened. Later, Vinod Agarwal also arrives at Sushil's stall and starts hitting him for flirting with women and being insolent. Passers-by stop this fight, and the secretary apologizes for his misconduct. Electricity is restored to Meenal's home.

Vinod then invites Meenal, Sushil, and Binny to a party he and his wife are hosting to celebrate the birth of their son. We switch to the present, and we see the Police Inspector Jairam Srivastav (Sreedhar Dubey) bringing Sushil to the station and beating him up. Meenal is warned that if she doesn't reveal what she did, it would be Binny's screams she'd be hearing next. Sushil begs the police to stop hitting him and tells him that he didn't do anything except breaking the transformer and that Vinod Agarwal made a move on Meenal.

Meenal takes the name of her previous employer Abha, saying she did it as she was jealous that she was infertile. We're taken back to the party where we see Meenal, Binny, Abha (the ex-employer) taking turns with the baby. Sushil arrives and is shown to be very angry. He steals some alcohol and heads out of the party, drunk, and breaks the transformer, leading to a power cut in the party. Vinod Agarwal and his wife get some flashlights and realize their baby is missing. They look for him, and Vinod goes to the kitchen to see the pressure cooker releasing blood instead of water. Abha arrives at the police station and says something to the police. The police then search Binny's bag and find the baby's toy in there.

Geeli Pucchi Bharti Mandal (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a worker at a factory. She is well educated and qualified and is looking to get a higher-paying data operator job in the same factory. Her dreams are shattered with the arrival of Priya Sharma (Aditi Rao Hydari), who is given the position not because she has the right technical skills for the job but because she has the right connections. Bharti is bitter and is told by a co-worker that she didn't get the job because of her caste.

Priya arrives at the canteen for lunch and tries to strike a conversation with Bharti, who doesn't reciprocate. Bharti gets into an altercation with a male co-worker and is hurt. Priya tends to her wounds and tells her that she reminds her of her childhood friend Kavita. When asked her full name, Bharti lies that she's Bharti Banerjee. Bharti is a lesbian. It is shown that Priya is in a loveless marriage herself and has lesbian tendencies. The two ladies go out together the next day when Priya reveals to Bharti that she doesn't know any of the technical skills required for the job but was only employed because of her palm-reading skills. This greatly hurts Bharti, and she cries while Priya hugs her. Slowly, they start developing a bond. Priya reveals to Bharti that her childhood friend Kavita doesn't talk to her anymore and is married and doesn't want anything to do with her because she's happy.

One day, Priya visits Bharti, and they have a moment. Priya is visibly upset and apologizes. Later on, Priya invites Bharti to her birthday party, where she lives with her husband and in-laws. Priya gets very emotional during the party, and when Bharti and Priya are alone, she reveals that she feels no love for her husband even though he's accommodating and nice. She also tells her that her husband Shiv Sharma (Sreedhar Dubey) wants a baby, and she doesn't feel right about it. Bharti tells her that it's not a defect and the only easy way out is to accept the truth. She then reveals to Priya that she's Bharti Mandal and that her family belongs to the lower Dalit caste whose women are traditionally in the midwifery business. This causes a change in Priya's attitude and she becomes distant..

Priya is then thrown a surprise birthday party in the office with her company's higher officials. Bharti is not allowed and is only called in to serve cake to everyone. Bharti cries, and when Priya comes to her, she tells her that the best way to deal with her internal conflict is to have a baby and become a mother just like Kavita. She then goes on to help Priya conceive while she handles Priya's work. A now pregnant Priya goes on maternity leave, recommending Bharti to take over her responsibilities. After the birth, Bharti visits Priya. Priya's husband mentions that she'd return to work soon, but Priya's mother-in-law is completely against it. She asks Bharti for her opinion since she comes from a family of midwives (thereby revealing that Priya told her family about Bharti's Dalit status). Bharti then takes her revenge and recommends against Priya returning to work (when she knew fully well that Priya wanted to return to work and her objection would torpedo the entire plan). Bharti goes to work and is told by her boss (Gyan Prakash) that Priya has quit and Bharti can now take over the job completely.

Ron's hilarious malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age, launch them into an action-packed journey in which boy and robot come to terms with the wonderful messiness of true friendship.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Twentieth Century Studios. Tech giant Bubble creates an algorithm to help children find friends and develop relationships through the use of robots called B-bots. A combination of a smartphone and a best friend, B-bots seem to take the world by storm. Soon everyone seems to have a B-bot... except for Barney, a middle-school student who lives with his father and grandmother in a small house on the edge of town. Barney's family is very poor, so he is not well-liked and tries not to be noticed at school. When students begin to bully Barney for not having a B-bot, his father and grandmother set out to get him one. They are not allowed into the store, but they discover a man in a loading bay who sells them a damaged B-bot. Barney and the B-bot, Ron, have a difficult start to their relationship. Ron embarrasses Barney in front of a popular girl who used to be his friend. But then Ron puts the bullies in their place, and Barney becomes best friends with him. When a bully discovers why Ron acts so unusually, he removes the security settings on his own B-bot and commences a chain-reaction that wreaks havoc throughout the entire school. Bubble's CEO Marc Wydell wants to meet Ron and learn more about him, but Marc's manager, Andrew, believes a defective unit could spell bad news for their company. Andrew will do anything he can to destroy Ron, while Barney will do whatever it takes to keep him safe. Barney helps Marc discover what's missing from Ron's algorithm, and they set off to stop Andrew and undo the damage the B-bots have done. Tech giant Bubble unveils their latest creation: the B-bot, created by Bubbles CEO Marc Wydell with the intent to make a robot buddy that is designed to help make friends, via algorithm. In the city of Nonsuch, California, middle-schooler Barney Pudowski is the only kid in his class who doesn't have a B-bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades, Rich Belcher, Noah and Ava have all become absorbed by their individual B-bots. On Barney's 12th birthday, his father, Graham, and his grandmother, Donka, come to realize that he doesn't have any friends. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but closes for the day, leading them to buy a slightly-damaged one from the store's delivery driver.Barney receives the B-bot as his late-birthday gift, but upon activating it, he quickly learns that it's defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, Barney decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed, but ends up running into Rich and his friends who taunt and try to humiliate Barney. The B-bot begins to fight back as his safety functions have been disabled, with him and Barney happily running off. However, Rich called the police and they along with Graham and Donka are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-bot can be crushed. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues him and names him Ron, a shortened version of his model number.When Barney and Ron's actions are reported, Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming while his COO Andrew Morris views it as bad publicity, believing Ron must be destroyed for the issue to be resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend and, while hanging out, runs into Savannah who tells Ron that he needs to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron gets out of the house and tries to get ""friends"" for Barney, bringing a series of random people to school. As Barney gets in trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-bots to have their safety features turned off.

Meanwhile, while Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-bot, Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron while Bubble uses their resources to take control of all the B-bots to go looking for Ron and Barney in the woods. Due to the cold weather and Barney's asthma, he becomes weak and Ron brings him back to civilization just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah and Ava rush out to help him.Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates before meeting Marc who patched Ron, making him like every other B-Bot. Barney demands that Marc access the cloud to get Ron's original personality, but Andrew took over the Bubble company and locked Marc out. Through an elaborate plan for Barney, Graham, Donka and Marc breaking into Bubble HQ, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database, finds Ron's original data by his light and uploads him back into his body, restoring him back to his original code. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-bot and realizing that everyone is just as lonely as he was, Barney suggests upgrading all the B-bots to have Ron's flaws. However, this means that Ron will be dispersed. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone, mixing Marc's friendship algorithm with Ron's code. Marc blackmails Andrew into giving his position of CEO back after secretly recording him admitting that the B-bots spy on their owners for profit.Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-bot, but are happy with their wild and weird personalities.

They work, recreate, and socialize through the dark of night instead while contending with drastically rising sea levels in most coastal cities.

Nicolas ""Nick"" Bannister, a self-esteemed private investigator living in Miami, administers thiopental to his clients which places them in a machine to assist with reminiscence. He works with his assistant Emily ""Watts"" Sanders in contract work for the Miami-Dade District Attorney's Office.

One day, a walk-in client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson), arrives asking for his help in finding a missing key she has been looking for. Nick is immediately attracted to her; he starts following her to a nightclub where she works as a chanteuse singer. Nick and Mae quickly fall in love but, unbeknownst to Nick, Mae is revealed to be working for a drug kingpin whose product consists of an addictive substance called ""Baca"".

Mae soon disappears shortly after her date with Nick, leaving him with only his memories. Nick tries to relive these memories by immersing himself in the incubator tank, despite Emily warning him not to do so, as it can cause brain damage.

One day, Nick and Emily are called by the DA to conduct an immersion evaluation on a crime suspect, who happens to be Mae. A simple case soon becomes an obsession after her disappearance as Nick soon finds himself in a fight to learn the truth about her past.

At the peak of Nick's obsessive investigation, the truth is revealed - the son of a land baron hired Mae to seduce Nick and steal the memories of his client Elsa (Angela Sarafyan), who'd been having an affair with his father (Brett Cullen). Mae and corrupt police officer Booth (Cliff Curtis) ended up tracking down Elsa and her son. Booth kills Elsa while Mae turns on him to help her son escape. Booth later kills Mae, but not before she leaves Nick a message in Booth's memory, which Nick then ""walks"" into. Mae reveals that she did genuinely love him and tried to get back in touch with him, but missed her chance.

Nick takes the evidence and reveals Walter's son Sebastian (Mojean Aria) as the mastermind, hoping to avoid sharing his inheritance with his half-brother. He also reveals where the boy has been hiding even since Mae saved him - at a white stilt-house in the middle of the water, where Mae had lived for a time before she came to Miami.

Concluding his investigation, Nick permanently puts himself in his memories, partially as a sentence for his actions, which included trapping Booth in a painful memory forever. It's then revealed that the entire film has actually been taking place in Nick's memory decades later, which might mean certain details aren't exactly how it really happened, with an older Watts arriving to check on her old friend in the memory tank, accompanied by her granddaughter (Nico Newton).",romance

After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. But they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. Fifteen years ago, a Techno Cosmic Research Institute strike force is ordered by executive Cynthia Utrom to capture rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who stole company secrets and technology, and any research. Desiring a family, Stockman creates a mutagen to create his own mutant family, starting with a housefly maggot. Before he can create more mutagen, the strike force arrives. While it is dealt with by the fly mutant, an explosion in the fight destroys the lab and most of the research while killing Stockman. Additional TCRI forces arrive and collect the remainder of the surviving research, but forget the mutant and the last canister of mutagen, the latter of which falls into the sewers below.In the present, in New York City, four turtles (Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello) have been raised by their adoptive father Splinter. While they are adept in the arts of ninjitsu, they are instructed to only leave for the surface world to get supplies for their home in the sewers.During these runs, they occasionally go and see attractions like outdoor movies, concerts, and sports, which makes them want to be on the surface more. When Splinter discovers what they have been doing, he punishes them, explaining their backstory: the mutagen from Stockman's house fell on the four baby turtles, who were found by Splinter (then a rat that was cynical and untrusting of the surface world, specifically of humans). While handling the turtles, Splinter also comes into contact with the mutagen, mutating all of them to have more human-like features. As the Turtles grew older and became more curious about the surface, he decided to take them to the surface where they are all nearly killed. This leads Splinter and the Turtles to all learn martial arts for their protection.Sometime later during one of their supply runs, the Turtles accidentally get the attention of a teenage girl named April. While yelling at the turtles but not seeing them, she gets her moped stolen. The Turtles are able to get it back after defeating the group that stole it and reveal themselves to her. April shows the turtles to her high school where the group discusses their goals: the turtles want to be embraced by the surface world, while April is an aspiring journalist, who wants to move past an embarrassing viral incident where she vomited from anxiety during her school announcements. They decide to help each other out; April has been investigating a series of violent robberies on TCRI technology by a criminal named Superfly, which have led parents to call for a city-wide curfew that would cancel the school's Prom. If she records and writes an article on who Superfly is and how the Turtles would stop him, April and the Turtles would be regarded as heroes and accepted. Meanwhile, TCRI has been following the reports of the Superfly robberies. Cynthia decides to place trackers on any technology to find him.Using leads from April, the Turtles find out that Superfly is collecting a piece of technology that night in a deal under the Brooklyn Bridge. They are able to find the part and pose as the buyers, and discover that not only is Superfly a fly mutant, but also has a gang of mutants with him like Leatherhead, Mondo Gecko, Genghis Frog, Wingnut, Scumbug, Ray Fillet, and Bebop and Rocksteady. Ecstatic that there are other mutants, Superfly invites the Turtles to go on a night in the town with him and his gang, where they bond. He explains his story and plan: like the Turtles, the mutagen evolved him and the rest of his mutant gang, and he took on the role of their father figure. When he brought them to the surface, they too were nearly killed by humans, but they escaped. In their escape, Superfly nearly killed a human. Deciding that humans are all evil and would never accept them, he would create a weapon that would turn the ooze into an airborne virus, which would mutate all non-human wildlife on the planet, and make them the dominant species while enslaving humanity in the process. The Turtles try to stop them by trying to escape with the last part, but Superfly and his gang escape with it, and the Turtles are left to be captured by TCRI, who had a tracker on the part. Having followed the Turtles from a distance, April leaves to get Splinter to rescue them.At TCRI headquarters, the Turtles are slowly ""milked"" of their mutagen, before they are rescued by Splinter and April. Betrayed by his sons' lies and despite stating that April is the only good human, Splinter decides that they will stop Superfly before they stay in the sewers permanently. When they reach the island, Leonardo and Splinter plead to the conscious of Superfly's gang, stating that if they enslave humanity then they are no better than the humans themselves. The gang agrees and everyone fights Superfly, destroying the machine in the process.Unfortunately, the ooze enlarges and combines Superfly with other local wildlife into a bipedal whale-like creature who dubs himself ""SuperDuperFly"", deciding to attack New York City. The Turtles, Splinter, the Mutants, and April head to mainland New York City to stop him once and for all. While the Turtles, Splinter, and the Mutants fight, April is able to overcome her anxiety and explain on live air to the public what is going on, leading the citizens of New York to help stop SuperDuperFly. Donatello discovers that the blowhole on the back of his neck carries a massive amount of mutagen, and the Turtles are able to drop a canister of anti-ooze into SuperDuperFly's blowhole, returning him to being a regular fly.The Turtles, Splinter, April, and the Mutants are recognized as heroes by the city, and the boys reconcile with their father, who apologizes for his xenophobic behavior. Soon after, the Mutants move into the sewers with the Turtles and Splinter, and the Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are all embraced as heroes.In a mid-credit scene, the Turtles are shown enjoying high school life: Michaelangelo is participating in the school's comedy improv team, Raphael has joined the wrestling team, Donatello has found the computer club, and Leonardo (who, throughout the film, has developed a crush on April) has decided to help her with her journalistic interests, now focused on TCRI who have mysteriously disappeared since the events of the film.

Gabi decides to enter the forest, retrieve the drone and rejoin Winston later, saying ""we can't just leave our trash here.""While walking through the forest, Gabi triggers a trap, which leads to a wooden stake piercing through her foot. Gabi removes the stake and heads deeper into the forest, which is soon covered by a red glow as night falls. She comes across a wooden house, and enters it to rest and recover from her injury. Barend and his son Stefan, two survivalists who had set up the trap and who live in the house, find Gabi resting in the house and treat her injury.Winston hears Gabi scream as she pulls out the stake, and he heads into the forest to look for her, but is unable to find her. After night falls, he encounters strange creatures in the forest, and becomes infected by a rapidlygrowing fungus while hiding from the creatures.Throughout the film, Gabi grows close to Stefan, and she also experiences nightmares that involve fungi growing from her body, later finding patches of fungi growing on her arms and legs. She learns from Barend that he used to be a plant pathologist who started living in the forest after his wife Lily died of bone cancer thirteen years prior, and that Stefan was conceived in the house, which was where he and Lily had their honeymoon. Barend then states that he met ""God"" while in the forest.Later, Gabi is almost infected by a similar rapidlygrowing fungus while sleeping, but she is saved when Barend wakes her up due to the creatures trying to break into the house. The creatures break in, and are revealed to be ordinary humans covered with fungus. Barend explains that the fungus infects humans and feeds on the eyes, mouth and lungs, and that they infect other people via spores. He also explains that the largest organism on the planet lives close to the house and is looking to spread, saying ""She was here long before the apes started dreaming of gods.""",horror

tt11426572,"After breaking off her engagement, leaving a successful banking career behind in the city, and moving to New Jersey for a fresh start (as a portfolio manager for an emerging market fund focused on eradicating women poverty, by helping them start new businesses with microloans), Asha Maurya (Pallavi Sharda) couldn't feel more alive. She is an economist by education. Tina (Ruth Goodwin) is Asha's EA at work & James (Damian Thompson) is her boss.

Her mother Suneeta (Veena Sood), on the other hand, thinks that her oldest daughter is about to miss a lifetime of happiness if she doesn't take her focus away from her new startup job and place it on finding a husband instead. Her dad Vijay (Rizwan Manji) cautions Suneeta against meddling with their daughter's life. Priya (Arianna Afsar) is Asha's younger sister and Nick (Sean Kleier) is her boyfriend. Priya and Nick live together, but her parents know nothing about it.

Taking matters into her own hands, Asha's mother creates an online dating profile in order to set Asha up with a ""perfect"" match. Suneeta sets Asha up with a Desi DreamDate on the internet. The guy shows up to her work, interrupts her critical business meeting with flowers. Due to this interruption Asha blows a critical investor pitch and now James gives her a tonne of homework to study every microloan their company has given in the last 25 yrs.

Enter Ravi (Suraj Sharma) -- or rather Ravi's parents (Dinesh (Manoj Sood) & Veena (Sonia Dhillon Tully)) -- who have the exact same idea for their son, who wrote Ravi's online profile. Ravi was youngest Indian to win the spelling bee and went to MIT at 16. Suneeta has already committed that Asha will meet Ravi. Priya wants the family to be happy at her wedding, and begs Asha to go on the date with Ravi. Asha agrees, and Suneeta also Guilts her into attending all weddings in their friend circle.

Asha and Ravi's reluctant first date is a bust, and they quickly discover that each is in a seemingly different place in their lives right now. Asha has just started a new job, while Ravi has just sold his start up, made some money, and is looking for a new challenge. Asha freaks Ravi out by coming on way too strong on the whole independent woman thing, and clears the deck by saying that ""they"" are never going to happen.

Suneeta takes Asha to a wedding, where the aunties are relentless and tell her that her ex-fiance Krish already got married to a younger woman. After realizing her mother is relentless and will not give up, Asha proposes a plan to Ravi that would be a win-win for both: a pretend relationship to be each other's date to get through the upcoming wedding season, as Asha is scheduled to attend 19 of these with her mom... She needs the time to do her homework assigned by James.

Yoshi (Julius Cho) is Ravi's best friend. Yoshi starts hitting on Priya, even though she is engaged to Nick. Through countless invitations, dances and dresses over the next three months, Asha and Ravi spend time with each other. Asha is always engrossed in her laptop, but Ravi continues to squeeze in time with her. They are videoed dancing at a wedding and the 4 parents already start planning a wedding date for them. Asha attends a corporate function with James and finds Ravi working as a DJ there under the nickname ""Spellbound"". Ravi tells Asha that music is the one thing that he does for himself. So, he is taking a break from work and sorting out his family. Asha kisses him.

Nick is a neurosurgeon and is working very hard (learning Hindi, taking bollywood dance lessons) to impress Priya's parents. His own parents divorced after 7 yrs, and he wants his wedding to last for 7 lifetimes. At another date, Asha finds that Ravi has been buying food from his dad's restaurant (as it has been struggling financially), via Yoshi (as his dad wont admit to any failures) and donating it to homeless food shelters across Jersey. They were about to have sex, when Asha falls asleep on Ravi's couch. The next morning Ravi and Asha admit that they like each other. They start enjoying each other's company through the rest of the wedding season. Asha falls in love with Ravi.

Asha gets another chance to pitch her fund to investors. This is the meeting she has been working for all summer. With encouragement from Ravi, Asha sells a vision of women empowerment in south east Asia, and aces the pitch. Asha is offered the head of the South East Asia division role. The company also received another massive investment from Red Star. Asha has to move to London and texts Priya that she has ""BIG NEWS"". Suneeta sees the text and assumes Asha and Ravi are getting engaged. She gets everyone invited, only for Asha to reveal the real news.

When the families pressure Ravi to propose to Asha, he tells his own truth that he dropped out of MIT and that he is a DJ. Asha also admits that she was only fake dating Ravi to keep her parents off their backs. But then Ravi reveals the name of his trust ""Red Star"", and its the same trust that made the big investment in Asha's company. Asha is really upset. He says Facebook paid him in stock for his DJ work and its worth millions. Ravi says that he loves Asha, but she says her heart is broken. Asha and Ravi are both miserable. Tina tells Asha that she needs to sign the London contract and go apologize to Ravi who really believes in her. Vijay meets Asha and encourages her to go to London.

The last wedding on the calendar is Priya and Nick. Suneeta tells Asha that she always knew that Priya and Nick were living together. She also tells Asha that she had a boyfriend from a different caste and her father married her off to Vijay. Suneeta wants Asha to go to London, but also says that Ravi loves her and is her happiness. On the day of the wedding, Priya is nervous and Asha calms her down by saying that if she doesn't marry Nick, she will regret it for the rest of her life. Asha then goes to Ravi and apologizes to him for being a great guy. back at the wedding, Nick makes a grand entrance on an elephant built on a outreach.

Ravi is the DJ at the wedding. Ravi proposes to Asha and she accepts. She stays in the US and spends her life with Ravi.",romance
tt14995258,"As a little girl, Roxana (Camille Rowe) used to go to the beach with her grandfather, who taught her to dive. The peace and tranquility that she experienced underwater were incomparable to worldly pleasures. She studied to be a marine biologist at college. One day, she noticed a poster of the world-famous free-diver, Pascal Gautier (Sofiane Zermani), who would be giving diving lessons to those interested. Without giving it a second thought, Roxana paid the course fee and reached the location on time. She met Tom (CÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©sar Domboy) there, a diving instructor who worked with Pascal. The two shared unmissable chemistry on the first day of class, but the moment Roxana had set her eyes on Pascal, she knew whom she wanted. There are 3 golden rules: 1. Always dive with a partner. 2. Dont try to dive as deep as possible 3. stay calmed and relaxed. Pascal had an incredible pain tolerance capacity, which was why he could endure the pressure and dive deep into the water. His calmness and capability impressed Roxana, and she could not take her eyes off him during the dinner party after the practice session. Pascal was a womanizer. Even with his girlfriend by his side, he continued to flirt with Roxana. They passionately made out in the washroom, and upon returning, his girlfriend broke up with him.

Pascal taught Roxana the techniques to stay under water. Their shared passion for diving brought them closer to each other. Roxana felt at peace in Pascal's presence, and she would not trade it for the world. She soon joined Pascal's team in a practice session. On the first day itself, she understood how risky the profession was. While Pascal was aiming to set a world record by diving 172 meters underwater, his team was spread across several levels (at every 40 ms, with oxygen tanks) to monitor him. The dive is set up with a sled that takes Pascal very deep and whenever he is ready to come back up, he activates an gas cylinder which provides the thrust to quickly shoot him back up to the surface. Only submarines have gone below 172 meters ever. at that depth, the lungs are the size of an orange and a person cannot be given oxygen as their lungs would explode. Even though Pascal managed to complete the dive safely, one of his team members lost his life. Stephane (Laurent Fernandez), a team member, blamed Pascal for sending the rookie 40 meters down.

The team needed a new member, and Roxana stepped in to fill the position. Stephane was against it, knowing how risky it could be for her, but Pascal trusted Roxana's capability. He believed she was a natural and could adapt easily. Roxana learned the safety protocol and was prepared to assist Pascal. On the day of the event, Pascal successfully dived 172 m, and the team celebrated the new world record. Roxana was on top of the world. She had never felt so alive. She informed her mother that she would leave her studies to accompany Pascal on his journey. Her mother was not supportive of her decision, but she refused to listen to her advice. A few days after setting a new world record, another free-diver managed to go 174m down. Pascal had to compete now, and he was aiming for 176m. But this time, luck was not on his side. He suffered from a blackout, and the doctor advised him to stop diving. Pascal was not ready to give up, and Roxana could not change his mind, knowing how passionate he was about his profession. As he took a break, he introduced Roxana to the world of free-diving. She soon set a new record for French women by going 56m deep in the CWF (constant weight with fins) category. She was celebrated by the media for her achievement, and Pascal watched her from a distance.

Pascal could not accept defeat when a US woman Naomi (Natalie Mitson) created another new world record (beating the men's record of 174 m by diving till 178 m). He was determined to dive 180m and create a new record, but his team and the organizers knew that he was not fit enough to do so. As Roxana rose to fame (she consistently continued to shatter more world records and was celebrated as a sex symbol), Pascal could feel his importance fading away. Roxana looked up to him; he was her lover and her mentor, but he could not stand the celebration anymore. He was proud of Roxana but disappointed in himself. He went as far as to state that he would be happy to watch her set the new world record rather than allow any other person to do so. It was important for him to be involved either as a participant or as a coach.

Roxana could sense the growing distance between her and Pascal. He would often leave her at night, and she would be left alone. Roxana's childhood was not easy. Her father committed suicide as a result of depression when she was 12. She always wondered why her father left her, and gradually she became obsessed with the idea of death. She attempted suicide, hoping to join her father, but her grandfather saved her life. We get a sense of how Roxana had been searching for the meaning of her existence, and it was only after meeting Pascal that she realized who she was meant to be. She emphasized how important Pascal was in her life and how the trophies and titles did not hold any value without him in her life. But he did not feel the same way. He was not ready to give up. For him, the competition mattered more than what he shared with Roxana. He decided Roxana would compete in the no-limit category even though his entire team thought it was a bad idea, but Roxana took up the challenge. She ends the argument by saying that she is doing the dive for herself. As she trained to prove Pascal right, he cheated on her.

Pascal attempts the dive at 180 m and blacks out again. Roxana wants to quit, but Pascal wont let her. Roxana soon found out about his affair (when she follows Pascal one night and sees him kissing another girl), and she sought comfort in Tom. She tells TOm that her next dive (the record attempt) will be her last. She and Tom have sex. Roxana wants to leave Pascal, but he smashes his hand into a mirror and guilt her into staying. Roxana continues to train with Pascal. Pascal finds out that ROxana cheated on him with Tom.

On the day of the competition, Roxana is thrown off by the appearance of the girl with whom Pascal cheated on her. Tom finds Pascal tinkering with the ballast tank, after he and Stephane did the final check on all the equipment. The dive starts and at the bottom, the ballast tank fails to open. Roxana is stuck. She runs out of air and her body gradually floats back up, where Stephane fishes her out of the water. Tom knows Pascal killed Roxana, but doesn't say anything to the police. The death is deemed accidental.",romance

In this all new movie we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with ""scream time."" To reclaim their bond they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong? At a middle school science fair, Wednesday Addams is set to present her experiment, but is dismayed when her family - Gomez, Morticia, and Pugsley - show up. She proceeds with the presentation, where she uses her pet squid Socrates' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved. The experiment is a success, but when Wednesday goes up to accept what she thinks will be a first place prize, she finds that everyone got a trophy for their efforts. Her work, however, gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange, who appears through a holographic projection to let her know he thinks her work is brilliant. Meanwhile, Pugsley attempts to impress girls by tweaking another kid's volcano project, but it ends up causing a huge disaster in the gym that sends everyone running.Back at the Addams home, Wednesday and Pugsley decline to show up for dinner. Fester goes up to Pugsley's room to try and help him find a way to woo the ladies. Wednesday sends her parents a very specific note for why she isn't coming to dinner. Gomez worries that the kids are drifting apart from him and Morticia, so he decides to take them on a family vacation.Gomez brings out a hideous road vehicle and gets Thing, Fester, the kids, and Lurch to join him and Morticia on the road while Grandmama stays behind to take care of the house. Before they hit the road, a lawyer named Mr. Mustela approaches Gomez and Morticia with the implication that Wednesday was switched as a baby at the hospital, meaning she may not really be an Addams, but the two ignore him and think it's just Wednesday trying to get out of going on the trip, but she says that she doesn't know who that man is. Once the family is gone, Grandmama throws a huge party. On the road, Mustela and his hulking henchman Pongo pursue the Addams family.The family is initially set on going to Salem, but Fester ends up making a detour to Niagara Falls because he is suddenly obsessed with water due to him mutating because of Wednesday's experiment with the squid. Pugsley tries to make another attempt with girls per Fester's advice, but his cheesy line backfires. Wednesday gets a voodoo doll of him and uses Pugsley to perform some dance moves, until she just tosses the doll over the Falls to torment her brother. When Gomez and Morticia attempt to bond with Wednesday, she snubs them. They then spot Mustela and Pongo looking for them, and Fester ends up knocking Mustela into the water before recovering Pugsley.The family then stops in Sleepy Hollow where they set up camp. While gathered around the fire, Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story from the night Wednesday was born where he went into the delivery room to see her, but all the other babies were crying, so he employed an Addams family tradition of putting babies to sleep by taking them out of their beds and juggling them all, potentially mixing up many babies in the process. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday was switched. Wednesday overhears the discussion and muses to Lurch about where she might really come from.Gomez brings everyone to Miami in an attempt to get in touch with Cousin Itt so he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio where he talks to Wednesday about his own rebellious phase in his youth, but he essentially says he owned up to who he really is.

Mustela and Pongo almost catch up with them, but Lurch knocks them away.To hide from their pursuers, the family goes to a motel where they enter a displeased Wednesday into a girls beauty pageant where she creates a scene.

Pugsley blows up the canyon, drawing more unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Fester starts to mutate further into a squid-man. Wednesday goes off by herself where Mustela attempts to get her again, but she gets the drop on him and traps him. His phone rings, and she sees that he was employed by Cyrus Strange, who suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and that he is inviting her to stay with him in Sausalito where she can hone in her potential in science. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she most certainly is not his daughter.Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her to keep her safe. The rest of her family learns where she is headed and go after her. Wednesday and Lurch stop at a biker bar to ask for help in getting to Sausalito, which they do after Lurch shows off his piano and singing skills by performing ""I Will Survive"". The bikers then escort the two to Sausalito.Wednesday arrives at Cyrus's home and meets his wife Ingrid, a bird-like humanoid being, and their pig-like daughter, Ophelia. Cyrus brings her to his lab where he shows her a formula he developed much like Wednesday's own that she used on Fester regarding human-animal hybrids. The rest of the Addams clan shows up, but Wednesday seems fully set on staying with Cyrus and no longer accepting them as her family. While Gomez and Morticia are sad, Pugsley tries to bond with Ophelia since they seem to be mutually attracted. However, Ophelia morphs into a pig, as that is what she originally was. When Pugsley brings this revelation to his parents, Cyrus reveals the truth and that he was just using Wednesday since her formula works better than his own. He then captures the family.Cyrus traps the clan in tubes where he plans to mutate them with his formula. He shows them to Wednesday so that she may remove any traits of theirs that she doesn't like, but she doesn't like seeing them trapped this way. She turns on Cyrus, but when he tries to have Pongo go after her and Lurch, it is then revealed that Lurch and Pongo knew each other and were really good friends at the asylum they were locked up at before Lurch was found by Gomez and Morticia. Pongo warned Lurch with a look that Wednesday was in danger. Together, the two brutes free the Addams family and knock Cyrus into a tube where he is doused with his potion.

Cyrus falls to his death while Fester pulls himself up with his tentacle, but he is now weakened. Wednesday uses the blood in the necklace that Morticia gave her, and Fester turns back to normal and is revived. Wednesday decides she is proud to be an Addams and reunites with her family.The family returns home, with Ophelia joining them as a regular human girl, where Itt has helped Grandmama turn the party around.

Wild Knuckles makes his way inside the temple and discovers the Zodiac Stone, but as soon as he does so, he is ambushed by a number of small metal guardians. He engages them in combat and then escapes the temple, only to discover that additional temple guards are pursuing him. The remaining five of the six pull Knuckles up, but then they steal the Stone from him and turn the tables on him, telling him that he is too old to lead the team and that they need new blood to take over instead. They cast Knuckles into the water and then take off into the sky. Young Gru, played by Steve Carell, is 11 years old and has always had the ambition of becoming a supervillain. As a result, the other children view him as a peculiar individual andavoid his company. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart are the ones who come to get him (all Pierre Coffin,along with the rest of the Minions). They make their way back to Gru's residence, where he discovers something that was sent to him in the mail. It is a message from Belle Bottom, as Gru had sent an application to join the Vicious 6 since he is their biggest fan, and Knuckles is his favorite villain.

He is seen just living with his unsupportive mother Marlena, who is played by Julie Andrews, as well as the rest of the Minions that he has employed as his henchmen. He is seen just living with them. Gru relays the exciting news to the Minions, who enthusiastically rally behind their ""mini boss"" despite Gru's displeasure with the moniker.It has been discovered that Wild Knuckles is in fact still alive and is currently residing in his mansion along with three of his own goons (John DiMaggio, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Jimmy O. Yang). He hasn't gotten over the fact that the Vicious 6 kicked him off his own team, and now he's heard that they're looking for a new member to join them. This has made him verybitter. The following day, Gru makes it to Criminal Records, where he is introduced to a younger version of Dr. Nefario, played by Russell Brand and described as an ambitious mad scientist. He demonstrates one of his most recent creations to Gru, which is a rifle that fires a sticky green hand that can grab anything. Nefario hands it over to Gru and then walks him through the hidden passageway that leads to the Vicious 6's lair. However, when he finally meets them, they dismiss him for being a youngster because Jean-Clawed imagined that he was a tiny man when they were reviewing his application. As they walk away, another candidate walks in and tries to impress everyone with his pilot outfit, but his jetpack suddenly stops working, causing him tosoar erratically through the air. The Vicious 6 make an effort to stop him, which diverts their attention just as Gru discovers the Zodiac Stone hiding behind them. He steals the Stone by using the revolver that Nefario gave him, but the six of them find him and begin to pursue him. Gru catches up with the other minions and hands the Stone over to one of them, named Otto. Gru flees on his horse while the six warriors pursue him. He makes it so that Strong Hold and Nun-Chuck are unable to defend themselves, and when Belle and Svengeance grab a hold of Gru's bike, he uses the rocket to get them out from there as quickly as possible. Knuckles, who was there the whole time, now follows Gru around in his vehicle after seeing all that happened. Once Gru and the other Minions have returned to their home, they wait for Otto to return from work. When he does, he gives Gru a rock that has googly eyes attached to it as a gift. Otto addsthat he ended up going through a series of unfortunate events until he found up at a birthday party, at which point he traded the Stone for the pet rock that was being given away to the birthday boy. Because of Otto's mistake, Gru is fuming with rage, and he immediately fires all of the Minion workers. He sets off on his own to locate the Stone, but as he walks along the street,the goons working for Knuckles capture him and put him into their van, as Kevin watches from outside the window of the vehicle. He then proceeds to inform the other Minion workers that their mini boss has been taken hostage. Gru is taken to where Wild Knuckles has been hiding out. Knuckles is perturbed to discover that Gru is not in possession of the Stone, which causes Gru to be overjoyed at the prospect of meeting his hero. He calls Gru's house in an effort to coerce his mother into paying a ransom, but Kevin answers the phone instead. Knuckles tells him to bring the Stone to San Franciscowithin the next two days or they will kill Gru.Otto, Kevin, and Stuart go to the kid's house that Otto gave the Stone to, and Bob joins them there as well. The youngster explains that he handed it over to his uncle, who goes by the name RZA and is already riding away on a motorcycle. Otto and the other three Minions chase after him on a tricycle as they search for a bus for an advertisement to take them to San Francisco. They go to the airport, where they put on disguises and pretend to be pilots and a flight attendant in order to join the following flight. Kevin and Stuart make an attempt to fly, but they wind up messing everything up by pressing all of the buttons and making a whole mess ofthings before safely landing (sort of). Knuckles torments Gru by placing him in a gadget resembling a record player, which brings him closer and closer to saws that are rotating. He dispatches his underlings into the world, andthose underlings end up discovering the Minions. They attempt to seize them since they believethe Stone is in their possession, and as a result, they find themselves in Chinatown, where an acupuncturist named Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh) watches the goons beat on the Minions. Chow, despite her age and the fact that she is a little old lady, demonstrates remarkable kung fu skills and fights off the goons. Chow informs the Minions that she is no longer active in that line of work when they beg her to teach them her abilities. Nevertheless, she gives in after the three of them give her the puppy eye expression. After the incident, the henchmen decided to give up on Knuckles. After rescuing Gru from the trap, he puts Gru to work around the house. Knuckles drowns while he is in the process of cleaning his crocodile-filled pool. Knuckles is grateful that Gru was able to rescue him and drag him out of the pit in which he was trapped. He takes Gru along with him on the burglary. They pretend to be a grandfather and grandson so that they can rob the Bank of Evil. Knuckles acts as though he is having a heart attack so that Gru can steal the keys from Mr. Perkins' house (Will Arnett). Gru is successful in his attempt to steal the Mona Lisa, much to Knuckles' delight. Otto pursues the Biker on his tricycle through a number of states, but he is unable to keep up with him and eventually loses sight of him. Otto is eventually found by the Biker, who then takes him up, transports him to San Francisco on his motorcycle, and presents him with the Stone. Chow teaches the Minion gang various forms of martial arts, but more often than not, the Minion gang injures themselves rather than improving their skills. They are able to quickly improve their talents, despite Chow's assertion that they have only passed the basic training. Unfortunately, the Minions have already made their escape, and they are already traveling to help Gru. The Vicious 6 locate Gru's house, rip off its roof, and then question Marlena and the other Minions about the whereabouts of Gru. The fact that Gru was kidnapped by Knuckles is revealed by one of the Minions. The group of six then travels to Knuckles' residence, where they proceed to rip the roof off, search the property thoroughly, and come up empty-handed. When Knuckles and Gru return, they find that Gru's home has been demolished. He is angry because he is aware that the 6 were the ones who did this, and he is frustrated that they wouldstill try to injure him after all of this time has passed. In spite of Gru's protests, he breaks the news to him that he is given up and just instructs him to go back home. A parade celebrating the Chinese New Year is currently taking place downtown. Otto ultimately causes a commotion by dashing into the crowd. Gru spies him as he is on the trolley and immediately starts chasing after him. Otto reveals the Stone to Gru, who then professes his admiration for Otto. Regrettably, the Vicious 6 have managed to catch up to them, and nowhave Gru in their custody. In the nick of time, just as they are about to be surrounded by theAnti-Villain League, Belle seizes the Stone and uses its abilities to transform both her and the crew into enormous animal monsters. Strong Hold transforms into a bull, Nun-Chuck into a snake, Svengeance into a tiger, and Jean-Clawed into a monstrous monkey. Belle transforms into a dragon that breathes fire (with his lobster claw arm). They seize Gru and bind him to the hands of a clock tower, which will gradually rip him to pieces over time. Knuckles, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob all appear to come to Gru's rescue at the same time. The three are reincarnated as a rabbit, a chicken, and a ram after being transformed by Belle. Despite the fact that Knuckles puts up a valiant effort, Belle is able to defeat him with her fire breath. The three individuals recall what Chow had said and let loose their inner animals; they then proceed to defeat the mutated version of Vicious 6. Gru is set free by Otto, and he immediately heads off to assist his buddies. The three Minions easily dispatch the six, and Gruseizes the Stone, which he then employs to transform his opponents into rats. They were taken into arrest by the AVL when they arrived. Knuckles suffers an injury and is subsequently detained; nonetheless, he assures Gru that they will meet again in the near future. The scene then cuts to a funeral, where it would appear that Knuckles has passed away. Gru delivers a heartfelt eulogy for him, only to later discover that Knuckles staged his own death andis in hiding.

Maurice correctly guesses that the rat catchers are trying to catch the rats alive to use them for entertainment, pitting dogs in rings with rats and betting on how fast they are killed. The rat catchers catch Sardines and use him for the ring but he is rescued by the others.Poisoning the food with laxatives, Maurice, Keith and Malicia manage to force the rat catchers to admit that they created a rat king when eight rats they left in a bucket got their tails knotted and developed an evil sentience, capable of controlling other rats. Maurice flees from the rat king while Keith and Malicia head to the woods to find the real pied piper and steal his magical flute, the only instrument known to kill a rat king. Meanwhile, the Big Boss, revealed to be the rat king in a pile of human clothes, has captured Peaches, one of the rats and Dangerous Beans, the groups spiritual leader, tries to rescue her. Confronting the rat king in the rat catchers' office, Maurice appears and hits him with the money they swindled, allowing him to escape with the two rats.In the woods, Keith and Malicia attempt to steal the flute from the sleeping piper but he wakes up and tries to kill them by forcing them to enter the burning oven. They are saved when the wind-up toy mouse Malicia previously took from Darktan distracts him long enough to lose the flute, allowing them to run back to town with the flute.Meanwhile, Maurice and the rats try to flee the city but are stopped by the rat king who summons dozens of rats from all directions to make himself stronger. Maurice runs into the woods to find the two humans while the rats are attempting to resist the rat king's call to merge with him. Keith and Malicia return and after some initial hurdles, he manages to play the flute correctly to beguile the rats away from the rat kings influence until only the king itself remains. The rat king uses the last of his power to freeze everyone in place but Dangerous Beans manages to break free, defying him again. The rat king then telepathically snaps his neck. Laying dying, Dangerous Beans reminds Maurice to be a cat and he uses his bottled up instincts to attack and kill the rat king, mortally wounding himself in the process. When Death and the Death of Rats arrive to take Dangerous Beans and one of Maurice lives, he successfully trades one of his lives for Dangerous Beans' life, allowing both of them to wake up.The rat king defeated and the food given back to the townspeople, the town and the rats come to an agreement.

He fancies himself a romantic, but the kind of once-in-a-lifetime love he's been hoping for just hasn't happened yet.

When Grace and Henry are chosen to co-edit the school paper, he is immediately drawn to the mysterious newcomer. As he learns the heartbreaking secret that has changed her life, he finds himself falling in love with her--or at least the person he thinks she is.Ã‚Â—Amazon Studios. In a voice-over narration, high school senior Henry Page (Austin Abrams) tells us how he has a pretty typical life and wants to be a writer, hoping to be the editor of the school paper. He is called to the school office by the principal Mr. Sharma (Adhir Kalyan) and introduced to Grace Town (Lili Reinhart), a transfer student who walks with a cane. He says they are both great writers and would be a perfect editor-in-chief duo for the paper, but Grace says she doesn't want to and leaves.After the meeting, Henry misses his bus, so Grace offers to give him a ride home - she then admits she doesn't like driving and lets Henry drive her car, and she ends up giving him her book of Neruda poems. Grace notes that Henry lives in a much nicer house than she does. At home, Henry's family, adult older sister Suds (Sarah Jones), dad Toby (Bruce Altman), and mom Gloria (Meg Gibson) are all thrilled he got the editor job.Mr. Sharma reveals to Henry that something changed Grace's mind and she is joining the paper. He tells them they need to come up with a theme for the paper's final issue. Grace tells Henry she's taking an assistant editor position, and she will edit but will not write anything. Later, Henry talks to Grace about the poem he read - and again misses his bus. They ride home together again. Grace walks home, and Henry sees a man come and get the car to drive it home.After again bringing Henry home, he asks her to hang out. She can't at the time but makes plans for the evening - she comes back and takes Henry out through a long winding woodland path to an old cotton mill that shut down years ago. Inside is a pond with fish that Grace likes to feed. They wade into the water, and Grace asks Henry if he's ever had a girlfriend, which he hasn't. She reveals she did a lot of her physical therapy in a car after the car wreck she was in. When Henry asks her more questions, she says she has to get going and asks if he can find his way home.At home, Henry glues together broken pottery, a Japanese art form that is a hobby of his. Suds comes home - she's living at home after a horrible breakup with her boss at the hospital, and she cries and Henry comforts her. At the urging of some of his friends, Henry follows Grace after school to see where she goes every day. He watches as she picks flowers and goes to a cemetery, where she sits at a grave, leaves the flowers, and speaks to it. After she leaves, Henry looks and sees the name Dominic Sawyer. Henry googles him and discovers he was Grace's boyfriend who was killed in the same accident she was injured in.His friend Muz texts him that Grace was spotted doing something weird, so Henry goes to the high school where he sees Grace on the track trying to run but limping. She falls, screams, and beats her leg with her cane. The next day, Grace tells Henry her idea for the theme for the last issue - ""teenage limbo"". Henry tells the paper staff they need to dig deep for real true stories, and Grace asks him to start. He opens up about a friend who committed suicide. Later, Henry asks Grace why she won't write anymore, and she explains she was asked to write a eulogy and couldn't find the words.Henry and Grace spend more time together and bond. He invites her to a Halloween party and she says yes. He\'s surprised after when she comes in to hang out and doesn\'t go to the cemetery for once. They begin to kiss but when the song playing in Henry's room is the song that plays in Grace's car, she gets very upset and storms out. She confesses to him about Dominic and says it was their song. She kisses Henry but says she's messed up and can't do this, and that she's not one of his vases.Henry's friends convince him begrudgingly to go to the Halloween party anyway where he smokes weed. He's surprised to see Grace there - he brings her a drink. Meanwhile, Henry's friend La (Kara Young) finally gets together with Cora (Coral Pena) the girl who had burned her before. Henry and Grace dance then eventually make out in Henry's room. She takes off her costume and he sees her leg scars. He admits he's never had sex before, and the two sleep together.The next morning, Grace wakes up and begins crying, startling Henry, who leaves her a panicked voicemail. But she responds that she thought it was cute, and finally drives her car herself to come pick him up. She takes him Dominic\'s memorial site, where she tells Henry she needed him to come with her for support. She puts her necklace Dominic gave her on the memorial, and tells Henry she wants to move on. She begins brightening up, finally eating with the school paper crew at lunch and fully dating Henry.One day at home a different car is in Grace's driveway - she tells Henry to stay outside and goes in. Shortly after, a woman runs out, gets in the car, and drives out in a hurry, backing over the garbage cans on the way out. Henry asks Grace if that was her mom but she says it doesn't matter. When he presses her, she snaps back at him to stop trying to fix her. Grace doesn't show up to school later, and Henry hears it's the anniversary of the accident and a candlelight vigil is being held. Henry runs to her house in the rain, where a man named Martin lets him in. He lets Henry wait in her room - which Henry realizes is Dominic\'s room.Grace arrives and reveals the truth - she lives with Dominic\'s family. She moved in a month before the accident to get away from her mom who was drinking and in bad shape. Henry sees that Grace went back for the necklace she left at his memorial, and that she wears Dominic's clothes. Henry is angry and upset feeling that she's leading him on and not moving on, and Grace says she's giving him as much as she can and she can't pretend to be better because he wants her to be. Henry tells her he loves her, but seeing all of the photos of Grace and Dominic all over, leaves dejected.When he gets home, his parents try to talk to him but he tells them they don't understand. Suds talks with him and he tells her the truth, and she explains how medically a breakup will feel like withdrawal, but that his body chemistry will adjust and go back to normal. He says he wishes he could take it all back, but Suds says he can't - Grace is a part of him now. Henry goes to Dominic's grave, takes the poem Grace had him read and burns it.At school, Henry gets a text from Martin that Grace is missing. Henry races to the secret pond and finds Grace sobbing in the water. She calls Henry Dominic and says over and over that it should have been her, that the accident was her fault and she shouldn't have been teasing him she just wanted to make him laugh. Henry says it's okay and hugs her. She seems to snap out of it, realizing it's Henry, and she tells him that when the crash happened her last thought was ""shit"", it wasn't even about Dom, and she wonders if that makes her a bad person. He assures her it doesn't. She asks what Dom's last thought was, and Henry says it was of her.Grace takes a collection of her Dominic belongings and drops them into the pond, then strips her dress off, explaining she was going to marry Dominic in it, and Henry takes her home. At school, Mr. Sharma tells the paper that Grace is taking time off and when she comes back will not be returning to the paper. Grace eventually returns to school but he stays away from her. For his final essay for the paper, Henry says that every person has felt the loneliness and scariness of being a teenager. He says that scars are not a sign of what has been broken, but rather what has been created.On the last day of school, Grace and Henry finally talk about their future plans. He's going to Bennington, and she's taking a year off to continue therapy. She says she needs to find her words again, and he assures her she will. She tells him he's extraordinary and kisses him on the cheek, and they hug goodbye - she slips something into his pocket. He checks his pocket and finds the poem he burned put back together, exactly like he does with his vases. He leaves school, missing the bus, but his friends ditch the bus to walk home with him one last time.",romance

tt13327038,"Drea and Eleanor agree to go after one another's bullies. Drea is at the peak of her high school powers when her entire life goes up in flames after her sex tape gets leaked to the whole school, seemingly by her boyfriend and king of the school, Max. Eleanor is an awkward new transfer student who is angered to find out that she now has to go to school with her old bully, Carissa who started a nasty rumor about her in summer camp when they were 13. After a clandestine run-in at tennis camp, Drea and Eleanor form an unlikely and secret friendship to get revenge on each other's tormentors. Drea has the perfect boyfriend - Rosehill's golden boy, and is even besties with the elite groups of the school. She is also an A-grade student, which makes her worthy of the perfect future with a scholarship at Yale followed by a secured life as a Howard law graduate. However, her efforts of 17 years of meticulously planning her life go for a toss when her boyfriend leaks her topless video.At the same time, Eleanor, a shy girl with past trauma of her own, joins the Tennis club where Drea is spending her behavioral-probation time. After learning about each other's trauma-stricken experiences, both plan for a sinister revenge game that changes everything in the coming season of school time. The devastating experience in school makes Drea understand that being vulnerable in front of people will not do her any good. She learns her lesson the hard way and as her headmaster advises her; tries to process her anger in a better way than punching the school's golden boy. We are also introduced to the second lead of the film - Eleanor. While overspeeding her car showing her rebellious personality, she talks to her mother over the call, who is delighted about her daughter's decision to join the tennis club. Although her mother pushes her to make new friends at the club, Eleanor is happy just being friends with her pet lizard - Oscar Winner Olivia Colman.Sun basking and reading Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train (the screenplay of the film is inspired by the book's film adaptation by Hitchcock) on the side field of a tennis court, Eleanor notices Drea impairing the new joiner's determination to play. The uncrushed spirit of Drea makes Eleanor instantly realize they will be best friends one day. I think teenage girls are eviler than adolescent boys. They wouldn't even think twice about hurting people back if someone hurt them. The film at this point makes sure we know this and learn from it. Eleanor understands how to get Drea's attention; hence, she tells her that Erica showed everyone the leaked video. And just like how the stars would have it, Erica's life is upside down when she is arrested for possessing drugs.While bidding goodbye to Erica for rehab, Drea makes sure everyone knows what she can do if someone dares to demean her. Later, when her car gets broken, Eleanor offers her a lift. And even though she is initially reluctant to engage with her, she agrees to tag along. We then learn that Eleanor was defamed for being a predator to young girls after she tried to come out to a girl she liked in her school.Bonding after learning about each other's past and realizing they have nothing else to lose - the girls become good friends. In the meantime, school reopens, resuming the extravagant life of the Rosehill students.On one side, Eleanor meets Gabi, who introduces her to nincompoops and elite groups of people from a distance. At the same time, Drea's return surprises her best friend, Tara - who forgot about her after the scandalous event. Max, on the other hand, continues to be a prick to Drea as he embarrasses her in front of the whole school by publicly apologizing for the misfortune she had to go through.Even though Drea had been putting on a lovely faÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â§ade of keeping her chin up the whole time, when Max tried to break her esteem like that, she finally breaks down. To avoid people's hollowness and terrible sympathies, Drea corners herself in the school washroom, which is her favorite spot. Eleanor follows her and tries to express that she is there for her. However, Drea just wouldn't let anyone take undue advantage of her feelings.When Eleanor shares her brief encounter with the girl who ruined her preteen life, Drea understands that both of them are going through somewhat similar turmoil. Because they have to endure the ordeal of all the shame, unwanted guilt, and pity of all these people who don't value them for their truer selves, they start manifesting verbal desire to hurt them. Drea's mastermind soon picks up a hint from her conversation with Eleanor, and both devise a cunning plan to bring the people down who caused them immense pain and cost them their happiness. Since nobody knows they know each other, Drea proposes Eleonor pretend to play someone very hard to please in order to earn Max's attention. Once he is in her loop, she will automatically get introduced to the group that was once close-knit with Drea. And even though Eleanor's inner closeted personality doesn't allow her to be someone like that, she gives in - because, in return, she gets to take down the girl who defamed her as a kid.Knowing that both of them share an almost Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction energy, or in their term Glenergy, the girls move on with the second & third step to their master plan - a makeover followed by trapping the first rat - Max.Once Eleanor gets Max following her everywhere, she starts behaving the way Drea taught her to - considering the latter knows what intrigues her ex-boyfriend in a girl. When Max invites Eleanor to his annual summer party at his beach house, the girls carefully prep for the next course of action. Drea wants Eleanor to spy on Max while he is busy partying so they can collect evidence on him being the scoundrel that he is in reality.Drea takes an interest in the gardening program that Carissa is running and soon learns that she is not just growing vegetables in the greenhouse. She tries to closely follow Carissa's moves, in order to learn more about her. While Eleanor is assisting Drea in executing her master plan, the latter has already plotted a revenge strategy for her new friend.While half the school is partying at Max's house, the other group is relaxing at the beach. At this point, Drea is attracted to Carissa's best friend, Rush, who entertains her with genuine love and feelings. Eleanor, on the other hand, finds her way to Max's room and gets her hand on his phone. She looks it up and finds out that he has been cheating on his current girlfriend - Tara, with the internet witch. However, when she is about to take pictures of the chats he exchanged with the girl, Eleanor finds herself hiding from the possible make-out session between Max and Tara.Tara is a considerably sweet girl by heart, and being in a relationship with her ex-best friend's ex-lover keeps haunting her. Hence, she mentions this to Max, but he doesn't genuinely seem to be affected by this. Noticing her new boyfriend's coldness, she immediately rejects him and storms out of the room. Soon, Max notices that Eleanor is hiding in the room, and he asks her to join him at his favorite place in the house. During their conversation, Eleanor effortlessly gets Max to unmask himself and talk about real things he wants to do. Seeing her genuinely take notice of what he has to say, Max gets enchanted by her. The next day, Eleanor and Drea slide into Rosehill farm to get hold of their next plan - steal shrooms from Carissa's greenhouse and dose everyone at the dinner that the latter has been working on for months. So far, their plans have been coming along perfectly as post-dinner the students started to behave erratically. This alerts the school headmaster who also received an anonymous tip (from Drea) to detain Carissa for growing drugs on the school property.Later that night, when the girls triumph over their evil actions to pin down people who hurt them, Drea suggests looking up everything Max has been doing. When Eleanor hacks his phone, she finds collective data that indicates that he is a big-time liar and attention seeker. This upsets Drea, but she has learned to grow a tough exterior that she doesn't want her friend to see. Eleanor explains that being vulnerable is alright, and she can trust her and live through the experience of her emotions as they come at this moment. Consequently, Valentine's day is right around the corner, and the school's editorial team has spoken to Max and printed his version of everything that happened after the leaked video. He presented himself in such a way that the entire school now believes that he is, after all, an accidental feminist.On the other hand, while Drea's life is busier with her new form of love connection with Rush, she is soon summoned by the headmaster for her dropped academic performance. She learns this will jeopardize her entry to Yale as they are considering revoking her scholarship.At the same time, after a failed attempt to bury Max's image to the ground, Tara helps plot rumors all around the school that she and Max are in an open relationship. Although it has a crazier response from the entire school, it doesn't go well with Drea, who had imagined a better outcome to her plan. Witnessing how things drastically took turns against her plan, Drea is angrier than ever. She is fuming at how Max continues to win. Eleanor can see how the rage and hunger for pulling down Max have engulfed Drea's vision and their friendship. And even though she tries to explain it, Drea seems to only be concentrated on strategizing more evil plans. At this point, Eleanor mentions to Drea that it's her birthday the next day; however, Drea ignores it and wants her friend to help her in getting her revenge over anything else. Taking time off from Drea, Eleanor meets Gabi (Max's sister) and realizes they both have a strong connection. After learning Gabi understands and sees her through, Eleanor admits her fondness for her. Later, Max & Tara throw a surprise birthday bash at Eleanor's house that completely sweeps her off her feet. When Drea discovers this, she decides to crash the party with Rush. It makes things uncomfortable as Max and Tara wonder how these girls know one another.Eleanor takes Drea outside, and both get into a heated argument where Drea reminds her that these people will not take two seconds to throw her out if she revolts against them. Eleanor points out how selfish Drea has been all this while and ignores her, considering they have been dealing with everything together. In a spiff of anger, she also tells Drea that there isn't enough evidence for her to blame Max for leaking her video. Taken aback by what she heard, Drea leaves and Eleanor realizes that Gabi overheard everything. When she tries to explain, Gabi points out that this is not her real personality and the sooner she realizes the better it will be for her. Later that night, Drea discovers someone removed the spark plug of her car again. She soon realizes that Eleanor is behind all this and has been putting up with a fake story to be her friend all this time.To find out more, Drea meets Carissa at the rehabilitation center to get to the bottom of finding out about Eleanor. After speaking with her, she learns that only Drea teased and spread rumors about Eleanor as a kid. All this time, Eleanor had been framing her so she could take revenge against Drea for ruining her life. Eleanor also leaked Drea's topless video, and all this time, Drea was, after the wrong person and teamed up with a girl that the film now reintroduces as a psychopath.The film now shows both sides of the story. On one side, we know Drea got bamboozled. And at the same time, Eleanor declares that teenage girls are indeed psychopaths. She still thinks that Drea is the same person who would do anything to be on the top at all times. Eleanor is not guilty of leading her friend's life to hell. Are we sympathizing with the wrong girl here after learning Eleanor's story?In the next moment, we see the two friends-now foes coming face to face with one another. Eleanor (or Nora) explains that she has had the upper hand the entire time because narcissists (Drea, in this case) are too focused on themselves to realize they have been played. There seems no end to the game Nora continues to play with Drea.She wants Drea to go to the admissions party and push her friends to do the craziest thing they have ever done. Nora plans to leak all this information and pin it on Drea - finally getting her revenge. She also tells Drea that Rush knows everything and leaves.On her way to telling the truth, Drea meets with an accident. Eleanor visits Drea and explains that this accident will help her get back to her friends, who will give her a free pass to the admission party. Later, at the hospital, Rush pushes her to give up everything and come clean to the headmaster. However, the time is not suitable to give up.Then, the big day of the event finally arrives. Drea and Eleanor reach the party with plans of their own. While at the party, Drea starts bullying Eleanor in front of her friends. The two of them move out and discuss that they are both hurting from the bitterness. In a rage, Drea throws the secret camera that Eleanor had asked her to wear so as to record the wrong happenings at the party. However, she also confesses in front of Eleanor that she has had a change of heart and she no longer wants to be this person fighting over things that are in the past.While the girls confront one another with their feelings, Max overhears everything. He tries to blackmail them by threatening to show all the conversations that had with each other over destroying him to everyone at the party. At this point, the film clearly establishes that young boys are plain dumb and the perfect example of narcissists who won't absolve anything that hurts their weak male ego. Thanks, patriarchy!Once Max is through blabbering his agendas and gone, Eleanor shows Drea that she had been recording everything he had said using her backup camera attached to her crop top. Back at the party, while everyone is having a gala time and Max is in the other room, the music stops abruptly. When Max comes out to check what stopped the music, he finds everyone looking at the recordings of his conversation earlier with the girls.While he tries to explain himself with his continued lies, everyone immediately dismisses him. The girls win and return to their old friendship as everything comes to a full circle. ",comedy

In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Marvel Studios. With everyone around him dead and Gamora's tragic demise in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) etched on his mind, a broken Peter Quill drowns his sorrows in Knowhere, the Guardians' headquarters. But life and time wait for no one. And as a devastating blow comes out of nowhere, leaving a dear friend incapacitated, the depressed Star-Lord must pull himself together to assemble his crew for one last life-and-death mission. This time, however, it seems the space defenders have bitten off more than they can chew. They say the third time's the charm. But with the dark past catching up with them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) thwart the sinister plans of an unstoppable intergalactic megalomaniac? Can they save the universe one more time?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. Due to losing his beloved Gamora during the events of Infinity War, Peter Quill is in a dismal state of depression. But now, Peter must rally the Guardians of the Galaxy to come back together once more when Rocket's past comes back to haunt him. Along with aid from the Ravagers and a duplicate Gamora (who doesn't remember her last life with the team), the Guardians travel to a world that is similar to Earth full of anthropomorphic animal experimentations that is ruled by the malicious High Evolutionary who seeks to make the universe better in his image. Now it will take all the wit and charm and strength of the Guardians to fight the High Evolutionary's plans and save the universe one final time. Peter is still depressed over losing Gamora at the hands of Thanos back in Infinity War and 2014 Gamora has no memory of her future relationship with Peter. But things become worse for the Guardians of the Galaxy, when Rocket is severely injured by Adam Warlock, son of the disgraced high priestess Ayesha. In order to save Rocket from dying, the Guardians decide to infiltrate Orgo Corp with the help from 2014 Gamora, who has joined the United Ravagers. The Guardians soon learn that the High Evolutionary is responsible for experimenting on Rocket many years ago on Counter Earth, but horrific truths will soon come into light for the heroes including the High Evolutionary's desperation to capture Rocket for his illegal experiments. As a baby raccoon, Rocket is a test subject for the High Evolutionary in order to create a Counter-Earth populated by anthropomorphic animals. He becomes friends with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor, three of the High Evolutionary's other test subjects. Rocket displays intelligence and aptitude beyond the other animals and deduces the flaw in the anthropomorphization process, angering the High Evolutionary. They later learn that they will not be part of the new Earth after the High Evolutionary perfects the formula to anthropomorphize. When the High Evolutionary suspects an escape attempt, he kills Lylla, Teefs and Floor, enraging Rocket, who mauls him and escapes.Years later, the Guardians of the Galaxy have established their headquarters on a rebuilt Knowhere. The night after settling in, they are attacked by Adam Warlock, a super-powered being created out of revenge by his ""mother"" the empress of the Sovereign, Ayesha, for previously stealing from her people. They are ordered to bring Rocket to the High Evolutionary, who has become obsessed with retrieving his subject for the purpose of isolating and replicating Rocket's intellect. During the fight, Rocket is seriously injured, leaving the Guardians unable to tend to his wounds due to a killswitch embedded in him. The team resolve to travel to the Orgoscope, headquarters of the High Evolutionary's company Orgocorp, in the hopes of finding an override code.With the assistance of the Ravagers and a reluctant 2014-Gamora, the Guardians infiltrate Orgosphere and retrieve Rocket's file. However, they are attacked by Orgosphere's guards, barely escaping after Peter Quill remotely activates the guards\' suit jet-packs. They deduce that Theel, one of the High Evolutionary\'s scientists, may have the override code stored in his memory, and decide to track him down. The team visits Counter-Earth against Gamora's advice, followed by Ayesha and Adam. With help from a family of bat-like humanoids, Quill, Nebula and Groot trace Theel to the High Evolutionary's ship, while Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket. Quill and Groot board the High Evolutionary's ship, leaving Nebula behind. Mantis unwillingly accompanies Drax to the High Evolutionary's ship, which begins to launch with Quill and Groot captured on-board, a process that also destroys Counter-Earth.Gamora stays with Rocket, but is attacked by a pig warrior sent by the High Evolutionary, who, herself, is killed when Warlock arrives looking for Rocket.

Mantis is able to persuade the Abilisks to side with them, and the three escape the chamber before reuniting with the Guardians and overpowering the High Evolutionary's army. Kraglin and Cosmo arrive in Knowhere, which Cosmo connects to the High Evolutionary's ship with the help of Nebula and Kraglin, through her powers of telekinesis allowing them to free the captured children.Rocket discovers a litter of baby raccoons and other test subject animals, but is attacked by a deranged High Evolutionary while attempting to free them before being rescued by the Guardians.

Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. In early-1953 Moscow, under the Great Terror's heavy cloak of state paranoia, the ever-watchful Soviet leader, Iosif Stalin, collapses unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage. As a result, when someone discovers his body the following morning, a frenetic surge of raw panic starts spreading like a virus among the senior members of the Council of Ministers, as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and ultimately take power. But in the middle of a gut-wrenching rollercoaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe; not even the feared chief of the secret police, Lavrenti Beria. In the end, who will prevail after the death of Stalin? Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. At the forefront of the machinations is N.K.V.D. Chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria (Simon Russell Beale), after Stalin, the most feared man in the U.S.S.R. Council member Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans. In the Soviet Union, everyone is used to Jozef Stalin's reign of terror, with daily lists of arrests for torture, banishment, or execution. When Stalin calls a radio producer for the recording of a 1953 concert, he realizes nobody was recording it and hastily arranges for a second turn, keeping even the audience in, despite having to replace the knocked-out director and bribing the soloist, who slips in a note reviling Stalin for having her kin killed. Reading that, Stalin has a fatal cardiac arrest. It takes ours till anyone dares enter his closed office, then ministers argue how to handle his death and struggle to find competent doctors--most having been purged--and are startled: the diagnosis is coma without realistic recovery prospect. Still political alliances are forged for the next Communist reign, including roles for Stalin's arrogant daughter Svetlana and maverick military son Vasily, both overambitious. The formal deputy presides over funeral and formal power transfer preparations but especially security chief Beria and Crutchev plot to become the one purging rather then purged, while inconvenient witnesses are on the next execution lists.",comedy

tt6217926,"The film begins with an introduction by its director, Leos Carax, and its writers, Sparks, in a recording studio. They, along with the principal actors, walk through the streets of Los Angeles and welcome the audience to the story.

Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) is a stand-up comedian popular for being brazenly controversial and provocative. He tells a sold-out crowd about his new fiancÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©, Ann Desfranoux (Marion Cotillard), a famous opera singer. He says that he feels she has changed him, but doesn't know how yet. When prompted to say why he became a comedian, Henry says it was to disarm people, since making people laugh is the only way he can tell the truth without getting killed.

Later, he picks up Ann from the stage door of the opera, where they are hounded by reporters. Henry mockingly dances for them.

Ann and Henry sing about how much they love each other and how fast their romance has progressed- he has recently moved into her mansion, tucked away in the woods- and a showbiz news blurb tells us that they have gotten married.

At the opera, The Conductor (Simon Helberg) works not as a conductor but as Ann's piano accompanist. He tells the audience about his dreams of conducting orchestras around the world, and his secret love for Ann. Ann, meanwhile, is happy with Henry, but feels that she doesn't know him- she sings that she fears him, yet doesn't know why.

Ann and Henry soon have a baby girl, Annette. She appears to the audience as a wooden marionette puppet, but is treated by the other characters as a normal baby girl. Henry seems to be nervous and unsettled by the idea of fatherhood.

While being driven to the opera, Ann falls asleep and dreams that six women come forward publicly to accuse Henry of abusive violence, and that Henry himself crashes into her car on his motorcycle.

Henry returns to his tour in Las Vegas, and tells his audience that the morning of the show, he had killed his wife. The crowd is shocked and confused as he goes on to say that he tickled her to death in bed, before attempting to kill himself the same way. He seems extremely unstable and is booed off the stage. After seething backstage a moment, he rushes back onstage to scream at the audience, who scream right back. He realizes he's made a huge mistake- and the remainder of his tour is canceled as his career begins to nosedive. Ann's continues to flourish, though she still feels something is wrong and growing worse in her marriage.

In a possible attempt to grow closer, Ann and Henry take Annette on a yacht trip that goes awry when they are hit with a massive storm. Ann soothes Annette below deck and finds Henry outside, drunk, in the middle of the storm. She tells him repeatedly to come inside, but he grabs her and insists on waltzing in the storm. Their struggle becomes more serious as Henry airs his frustrations over Ann's success and his own failings. As they fight, he appears to push Ann over the side of the boat, which kills her instantly.

Henry rows Annette to shore in a lifeboat and waits for help. As they wait, the full moon begins to shine on Annette's face and she begins to sing a beautiful aria. Henry believes he must be imagining it and goes to sleep. We see the ghost of Ann, dripping wet, tell him that she will haunt him forever through Annette's voice.

Later, the police question Henry about Ann's disappearance but quickly conclude it was an act of God, and there was nothing Henry could have done to save her. On the way home, Henry buys Annette a spinning lamp for her bedroom that projects stars across the ceiling. When he turns it on for her, she begins to sing again, and he realizes he was not imagining her strange gift.

Meanwhile, the Conductor has finally become a conductor, and leads a rehearsal as he tells us his suspicions about Ann's death. He reveals they had had a brief affair the week before she met Henry, and that his love for her has never died. Henry invites him over to discuss Annette, and he feels obligated to attend despite his mistrust of him.

Henry shows the Conductor Annette's gift, and proposes they take her on a global tour to sing for the world. The Conductor insists such a show would be exploiting Annette, but Henry brushes him off. Reluctantly, the Conductor agrees.

Annette's ""miracle"" immediately becomes a worldwide sensation as they tour internationally. Henry seems to revel in the money and attention she has gotten back for him. The Conductor starts to take on much of Annette's care, as Henry goes out to party in the various cities they visit.

Back in L.A., Henry returns home drunk to find that Annette is singing the love song he and Ann used to sing together. He turns on the Conductor, insisting he had no right to teach it to her. The Conductor says that he had written the song for Ann first, and in fact believes he could be Annette's father. Enraged, Henry attacks him and drowns him in the swimming pool, unaware that Annette is still awake.

Henry decides to retire Annette from singing, but not before one final performance at the Hyper Bowl Halftime Show. Annette is flown into the stadium and introduced with much fanfare, but freezes up and will not sing. Henry watches as the music starts over several times but Annette remains silent. Finally, she says, ""Daddy kills people.""

Time passes, and is Henry arrested for both murders and completely reviled by the public. At his trial, he refuses to go under oath because he says he will be killed if he tells the truth. He begins to hear Ann's voice and sees her above him, looking as she did when she was alive- they sing together about how Henry would change his actions if he could go back. She disappears and is replaced by the dripping wet ghost of Ann that has been following Henry; she tells him that she is the one who will be keeping him company in jail.

Annette visits Henry in prison some time later. She sits in front of him, and as they begin to talk, he finally sees her not as a puppet but as a real little girl (Devyn McDowell). Henry attempts to explain himself, but Annette says that she doesn't think she can ever forgive him. She says he now has nothing to love, not even her. She is removed from the visiting room by the guard, Henry watching her leave through the window. He turns briefly to the camera and tells the audience to stop watching him. The puppet lies lifelessly on the floor.",romance

tt15255288,"Four years after their escapade in Monte Carlo, Nick (Adam Sandler) and Audrey Spitz (Jennifer Aniston) are full-time private detectives. But their business is not going too well. Accepting an invitation from their friend, Vikram ""The Maharajah"" Govindan (Adeel Akhtar), to attend his wedding on his private island, they hope their association with him will lend their failing detective agency some professional credibility.

There, they meet Vik's French fiance Claudette Joubert (MÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©lanie Laurent), his flirtatious business partner Francisco Perez (Enrique Arce) (claims to have slept with 10000 women), his former fiance Countess Sekou (Jodie Turner-Smith) and her lady-in-waiting Imani (Zurin Villanueva), his reticent sister Saira (Kuhoo Verma), his ruthless bodyguard Lou (Myo Leong), and their old friend Colonel Ulenga (John Kani), who is now missing his left arm after saving Vik from an assassination attempt in Mumbai.

At the wedding, Audrey notices a cloaked figure following Vik's elephant. A dead body falls from the elephant and turns out to be Vik's bodyguard, Lou. Nick suspects that it is a diversion and watches Vik's abduction by a mysterious figure. Realizing that they are once again ensnared in a conspiracy, the couple determine that at least two perpetrators must have been involved: one to create the diversion and the other to kidnap Vik. Only the board members knew about the elephant being part of the ceremony. So, they are all suspects now. Francisco tells Nick and Audrey that Claudette had to sign a brutal prenup, which the board insisted on, before marrying Vik. Saira tells them tat Claudette is just wrong for Vik. Claudette tells them that Vik knew Francisco's dark secret. Sekou says that Francisco has 85 paternity suits against him and is siphoning money from the company to pay for it.

The next morning, the group is joined by a team of professional detectives led by former MI6 hostage negotiator Connor Miller (Mark Strong). Nick and Audrey try to impress Miller, but Miller considers them as a suspect since their business is failing and they need the money. The kidnapper calls and tasks Nick to deliver a ransom of $70 million to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in exchange for Vik.

Traveling to Paris, Miller takes Nick and Audrey to the exchange point with the $70 MM in cash. The kidnappers force the couple into a van at gunpoint. Inside, the couple fights them, ending with the kidnappers dead and the van crashing into CafÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â© Procope. They realize they are being framed for Vik's abduction with footage of Nick running out of the tent brandishing a knife; Miller arrives and clarifies that the footage is a deep-fake. After taking the briefcase of money and asking them to meet him at the La Madeleine, Miller is seemingly killed when his car explodes. A mysterious figure steals the briefcase, only to be robbed of it when hit by a truck. The truck driver walks away with the case.

With the assistance of Inspector Laurent Delacroix (Dany Boon), the couple trace the truck to a countryside chateau where they are ambushed by Sekou and Imani, who insist they are not the kidnappers and only want the money. Sekou shoots Imani and attempts to kill the couple, but is herself shot dead by a dying Imani. Nick and Audrey escape and call de la Croix and the others, requesting that they tell the kidnappers that Vik be brought to the Le Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tower and they will hand over the money. Vik appears at the rendezvous, strapped into a bomb vest. Nick reasons that the killer would never jeopardize the ransom. As he predicts, the bomb's countdown is suspended and Miller, the mastermind of the abduction, appears; he had faked his death by hiding in a bomb-proof titanium chamber within the car moments before the explosion. He attempts to kill the group, along with Susan (Jillian Bell), a lonesome widow that was looking for her long lost lover Gary (they had promised each other to meet at the Eiffel Tower after 10 yrs on that very night), but Audrey clings to his harness and is pulled to the top floor.

Nick pursues them, subdues Miller's men, and destroys the detonator. Miller throws Audrey, who is still connected to his harness, off the tower. The two men engage in hand-to-hand combat, culminating with Nick opening the briefcase and dispersing the money into the wind. Meanwhile, the group helps disengage Vik's bomb, and Susan tends to de la Croix, who was shot by Miller. Susan and de la Croix instantly fall in love after de la Croix shows her how to make circles with smoke (from his vape). Up on the top floor, Audrey reappears and helps Nick tie Miller's harness to the tower's elevator mechanism, throwing him into the rotor blades of his getaway helicopter, which explodes and crashes into the Seine.

Returning to the restaurant, Audrey mistakes Saira's darkened hand for blood, but Saira insists her henna smeared during the commotion. Audrey realizes that Saira was not present when Vik's elephant was ushered into the reception ceremony, and recalls that the cloaked figure who killed Lou had a wet henna stain on their clothes. Saira is the second conspirator; she was upset that Vik's parents gave him sole control over the business, and she had previously tried to kill Vik in Mumbai. Exposed, Saira attempts to shoot Vik but he is shielded by Ulenga-who loses his right arm, then Claudette knocks her out with the briefcase.

With the commotion concluded, Vik and Claudette decide to elope and give Nick and Audrey $10 million (in a dinosaur leather briefcase worth $3 MM). On a honeymoon in Greece, they are accosted at gunpoint by their supposedly European helicopter pilot who turns out to be American; he steals the millions and jumps out of the helicopter, leaving them scrambling for the controls.",romance

One of the most sensational cases from their files, it starts with a fight for the soul of a young boy, then takes them beyond anything they'd ever seen before, to mark the first time in U.S. history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defense. In 1981, only a few years after Michael Taylor's particularly violent Ossett Murder case that shocked the United Kingdom, and Janet Hodgson's blood-curdling Enfield Haunting case in The Conjuring 2 (2016), the experienced investigators of the unexplained, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, found themselves in Brookfield, Connecticut.

Then, more and more, the suffocating stranglehold of evil tightened around everyone involved, leading to murder and Johnson's incarceration. But, according to Arne, evil forces were at work.

tt15509244,"DivorcÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©e Helen books a 'beginners' Appalachian Trail survivalist course. While seeking her brother Duncan before leaving, she finds his best friend Jake so asks him to give him the keys to housesit.

When Helen's ex Mike calls, reminding her their sixth wedding anniversary would have been today, she has a flashback. Both Jake and Duncan were at the wedding, disapproving of the very awkward Mike.

Northbound Helen pops in to see Gigi, the grandmother who'd raised them, on her drive from Pittsburgh. Staying in the designated Connecticut motel, the next morning the young guide Beckett gives them an overview of the hiking trip. They introduce themselves and 40ish Helen discovers she's one of the eldest participants, which fellow hiker Hugh happily points out. Then she is shocked to see Jake introduce himself.

Confronting Jake afterward, as he won't leave, Helen tells him to not interact with her and keep their connection quiet. Shortly after the bus drops the group off at the 50+ mile hike's starting point, Helen gashes her leg on a rock. Jake, a doctor and therefore the designated EMT, dresses her wound and congratulates her on her divorce.

After a short time, Helen gets scolded for stepping on a log, one of many rules they should have learned beforehand. Beckett shows them how to put up a bear hang to protect them and their food. Helen's tentmate Windy is 'crushing on' Jake, but Helen sees him as immature.

The next morning, Helen asks Jake for help with blisters as she didn't bring the correct footwear and didn't prevent it. Beckett casts some of the blame on Mason, the Wall Street hiker, for not being a team player and pushing everyone.

Windy tries to promote positive thinking. Everyone gets to know each other, Hugh sharing that he had been an aspiring actor but now sells insurance. When they are next alone again, Helen confronts Jake about his staring and hovering. He says he simply fears her returning to Mike, as he's not good enough for her.

As they have been hiking for ten days, Beckett has them rehike a route, grouped according to speed. He insists Mason go with the slower hikers to promote team-building. Before leaving, Beckett has a fit when he finds Helen's goal list which had fallen from her pocket. Noone fesses up to owning it. Jake, who knows it was hers, quietly calls her out for it, then hands her something to read later.

In Helen's hiking group, they gossip about Jake and Windy, suggesting there is chemistry. A quick kiss is mentioned. While everyone else is checking the map, Hugh foolishly plays balance beam with a rotten log. Severely damaging his leg, as Mason freezes up, Helen offers to go for help.

Helen explains what happened when she reaches the lead group after nightfall, and they decide to go find them at dawn. Sharing a tent with Jake, she tells him her middle brother Nathan had drowned when she was six. Helen felt responsible, and the family unraveled with first their dad, then their mother, leaving them. They both act jealous: Jake over her accepting Mike's constant messages and Helen over his kiss with Windy, although it was during a game of Truth or Dare.

Waking at dawn, Helen takes the other three to Hugh and company. She and the men carry him on a makeshift stretcher to an awaiting ambulance three miles away. The next day, they all relax and chat and when dusk falls, Helen seeks out Jake who has departed from the group in the woods. Grateful, he hugs her then explains he inherited a degenerative eye disease causing him to slowly lose his sight. It currently affects him most at night and is the reason why he couldn't find them and stopped practicing medicine. They nearly kiss but are interrupted.

The next day they head for the bus, which takes them back to the motel. Meant to participate in karaoke and other farewell activities, Helen ducks out after overhearing that Jake has someone at home. Driving to Gigi's, she can only think of him. Finally reading what he had written her (a poem by Pablo Neruda), she discovers he has feelings for her. Gigi sees the trip has changed her and thinks she might be in love.

Duncan comes over, and Helen apologizes for how she's treated him over the years and vows to be a better sister. Duncan insists Helen go out with him and Gigi to celebrate a birthday. Jake shows up and they finally kiss after he confesses he's loved her for years.",romance

In this setup, the movie starts off.Next a series of news snippets are inter played as the media is shown portraying the  protests by BLM and Antifa in a manner that satirizes the situation, juxtaposing actual scenes of arson against the news anchor's statements of peaceful protests. Two protesters are then shown discussing the suppression of information for ""the good of the people.""This morphs into the first scene of Hunter Biden, and one of his many parties that throw around cash, sex, and drugs. At the end of this first scene, with the revelers mostly asleep and strung out, there is a humorous presentation of a small dog, using dialog bubbles to tell Biden he's being used by freeloaders who don't really care about him. Agreeing with the dog, Biden orders everyone out of his apartment.We then see Hunter meet up with another recurring character in the movie, named Grace Anderson, who spends much of the movie as a combination of Hunter's girlfriend, savant, and moral conscience. Her first interactions show Hunter entering a drug purchase, followed by the first of many intimate conversations about their lives and troubles.Next enters Joe Biden into the movie, meeting with his son Hunter in the back of a VicePresidential motorcade, discussing the laptop that Hunter Biden abandoned at a computer repair store. They discuss how the laptop became the property of the store owner. They discuss how the FBI now has the laptop and how Joe Biden needs to know what's on the laptop so he can work to create cover stories in the media.This limo scene is interrupted by scenes of Grace meeting with one of Hunter's personal assistants. This assistant then works with Grace to try to find web articles to discuss what Hunter had previously told her took place. Being unable to find any information that matched what Hunter had told her took place, Grace is told she must find other websites to find the background information she seeks. Grace then consults those other websites and finds her corroborating information.The Secret Service agent then provides a brief summary of the convictions these Biden associates received, while describing some of their most significant criminal actions, as well as the financial details of the Hunter Biden business deals. This is when the movie first portrays Joe Biden telling an audience how he forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter, in return for a  billion loan guarantee by the Obama administration.The story then returns to the limo, where Hunter and Joe Biden end their conversation with the mention of removal of travel bans against Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs in return for Hunter no longer being prosecuted, along with revealing a smear campaign against the computer store owner by portraying him as a Russian agent.Following this, is another extended scene between Hunter Biden and Grace Anderson, where the two discuss the Peoples Republic of China. In this exchange, details of Hunter's business deals with Chinese business leaders are played out in character. It is during this scene where the apartment manager evicts Biden due to the salacious nature of his many parties. This extended scene concludes with Anderson speaking about Chinese human rights violations, as well as confronting Hunter on the true roots of his actions and selfdestructive behavior.Hunter Biden's personal assistant then gives to Grace a recording of her many conversations with Hunter Biden, a recording she tries to give to a freelance journalist named Bob, who is working at the time for the Washington Post. This journalist is shown as refusing to accept the story and urging Grace to forget all about it. Grace then posts the information she has online, and is shown immediately suffering social media cancellation and attacks.The final scenes play out showing Rudy Giuliani accepting Grace's invitation to meet, releasing the recordings. The movie concludes by showing the aftermath of the public release of these conversations, prior to the  election, that force the FBI to accelerate their criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, as well as force mainstream media to retract their previous denials of the laptop information. This culminates in a revisionist outcome of the  election in which Donald Trump is reelected by a wide margin, presumably due to the controversy created after the media reports the details of the Biden business deals and Hunter Biden's personal lifestyle, as well as other media reports of Hunter Biden being arrested by the FBI for various charges.These revisionist narratives are then stopped, showing a concluding scene of Grace refusing to release the recordings, and lamenting what could have been if she had done so. She reconciles with her estranged father in an embrace and final statement that perhaps, ""in the end, the truth itself has become the fairy tale.""The movie fades out with several real world media clips as well as actual video of Joe and Hunter Biden and their activities. These clips show  efforts by mainstream media to castigate the New York Posts' laptop articles as being Russian disinformation, followed by reports they made in  and  that the laptop information is genuine.",comedy

A Brooklyn plumber named Mario travels through the Mushroom Kingdom with a princess named Peach and an anthropomorphic mushroom named Toad to find Mario's brother, Luigi, and to save the world from a ruthless fire-breathing Koopa named Bowser. The film starts in an ice kingdom of blue penguins where a large menacing ship belonging to the Koopas. Once they land, the Koopa army emerges to confront the penguins. Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson) comes out to introduce their king, the sinister Bowser (Jack Black). While the penguins attempt to (pathetically) fight back, Kamek uses his magic to throw them to the side before Bowser unleashes his fire breath to melt the penguins' ice castle. He then goes to a box with a question mark and crushes it, revealing the Super Star. Bowser then boasts that there is nobody who can stop him.In Brooklyn, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are watching a commercial for their new plumbing business. They get mocked by their ex-boss Foreman Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco), but Mario steps in to defend his brother since Luigi is nervous and easily afraid. Moments later, the brothers get a phone call for their first big job. Unfortunately, their van breaks down, forcing them to run across a construction site to make it to their destination.The brothers arrive at the home of a wealthy couple, where Luigi already makes a bad impression when he steps on the toy of the couple's dog, Francis. Mario quickly fixes their leaky faucet, but Francis goes after them. This leads to the bathroom getting more wrecked and Francis nearly falling out the window until Mario and Luigi save him.The two return home where they live with their family and are having pasta with mushrooms (and Mario hates mushrooms). Their parents don't have faith in their plumbing business and write it off as a silly dream, leaving Mario dejected. Luigi goes to comfort his brother, who says he wishes he didn't always feel so small.

She knows Bowser is a threat and is making plans to face off against him with the help of the Kong army after he took the penguins, prisoner. Toad helps Mario sneak into her castle, and Peach is ecstatic to meet another human. Mario asks for her help in finding Luigi, and she says she will once she sees what he is made of.Peach shows Mario an obstacle course that he must go through to prove himself. She does it effortlessly in one go, and she shows him the power-ups that he can use, but unfortunately for Mario, they're mushrooms. He eats one that makes him bigger and stronger, but whenever he gets hit, he loses the power-up. Mario endures hours of falling platforms, man-eating flowers, and wrecking balls. On his last try, he nearly makes it before the flower chomps on him, but it's enough to convince Peach that Mario can help fight Bowser. Peach departs from the Toads as they head to the Kong Kingdom, but they are joined by Toad.Before their journey, Peach demonstrates an ability to Mario to produce fire using a flower. He asks where she came from, but Peach isn't sure. She remembers coming to the Mushroom Kingdom as a lost child, and the Toads raised her before making her their princess.Aboard the Koopa ship, Bowser explains his plan to marry Peach and rule together with her using the Super Star. Later, Bowser sings a piano ballad to himself before Kamek comes in to inform him that Peach has been spotted with Mario, making him super jealous.

Mario steps up, determined to save Luigi, so Cranky agrees to help on the condition that Mario fight Cranky's son in the arena and win. Mario agrees, despite Peach saying it's a bad idea.In the arena, Mario is pitted against Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). Naturally, the much smaller Mario initially gets whooped by DK, until he starts to take advantage of power-ups. His first attempt goes poorly when he eats a blue mushroom that makes him tiny. He then gets another power-up that gives him a cat suit, which allows him to use cat-like reflexes against Donkey Kong. The ape throws barrels at Mario, but he dodges them and uses his power to punch DK down below, defeating him. Cranky agrees for the Kong army to help Peach.Luigi is imprisoned alongside the penguins and their king (Khary Payton), along with a cheerful (but grim) little star called Lumalee (Juliet Jelenic). Bowser also learns about the Kongs' alliance with Peach, and he plans to stop them.The heroes assemble karts to go after the Koopas. They ride across Rainbow Road to head after them, but Bowser's army ambushes them. The Koopas attack, but Mario and the others are able to fend most of them off. Toad almost falls off but Peach rescues him. A Koopa General (Scott Menville) tries to use his rig to kill Mario, but he avoids the attack and blows up the General's vehicle. The General gets angered and activates his blue shell, performing a kamikaze attack that destroys part of the bridge and sends Mario and Donkey Kong falling into the ocean. The Kongs are captured, and Peach rushes back to the kingdom with Toad to warn everyone.Mario and DK argue as they fall into the water, but DK is knocked out by a falling kart tire. Mario saves him but they are both devoured by a gigantic Maw-Ray. They find a rocket from DK's cart and use it to blast themselves out of its stomach and on their way back to the Mushroom Kingdom.Peach returns to get the Toads to evacuate, but Bowser and his goons show up. He offers his proposal to Peach, who immediately refuses until Bowser orders Kamek to torture Toad. Peach then agrees as long as the Toads are unharmed. Kamek then goes to the other prisoners to announce that they will be sacrificed.The wedding ceremony is about to go off until Bowser presents the sacrifices. Peach then says she was never going to marry him and takes in a blue flower to give herself ice powers. She freezes the mechanism and Bowser while the Toads begin to fight the Koopas. The mechanism breaks apart and the prisoners are lowered further into lava, with Luigi nearly dying first until Donkey Kong arrives, having been powered-up with Mario, to raise them back up. Luigi falls until Mario shows up in a Tanooki outfit that lets him fly. Bowser breaks free from the ice and orders a Bomber Bill to be launched at the Mushroom Kingdom to obliterate it. Mario flies in Bill's eye and gets the giant bomb to chase after him, leading him to the portal pipes where Bill explodes. The ensuing explosion causes everyone in the kingdom to get pulled in.Everyone ends up back in Brooklyn, including the Koopa ship. A now enraged Bowser attacks Mario and beats him down, saying he has no chance to stop him. While Peach and DK try to fight, Mario hides in the pizzeria and sees his commercial with Luigi, inspiring him to keep up the fight. Bowser loses the Super Star, and Mario tries to grab it, but Bowser lets out his fire breath until Luigi steps in to shield Mario with a manhole cover. The two then run to the Star and touch it, making them invincible and powerful, officially becoming THE SUPER MARIO BROTHERS!

tt13964404,"In July , an experienced outdoor enthusiast vanished in Northern Nevada while on an outdoor excursion. After an extensive search, he was never located. On the threeyear anniversary of his disappearance, friends and loved ones recall the events leading up to his vanishing, and for the first time, speak about the horrifying conclusion of his fate. In the style of a documentary film, the first part focuses on the police ""missing person"" report of amateur hiker Gary Hinge Toward the end of July , Gary hiked to an unspecified area in the Great Basin Desert Nevada. His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.Initially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found,  miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather the hottest time of the year and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a ""cold case"". Thus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found.",horror

In December 1973, 33 years after the events of A Christmas Story, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) lives in Chicago with his wife Sandy and two children, Mark and Julie. Ralphie has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it.

tt10366514,"March 31, 1889 - Gustave Eiffel (Romain Duris) sits in his office, atop the newly completed thousand-foot (300-meter) iron tower he has designed and constructed - the Eiffel Tower.

September 1886 - Eiffel receives an award for his ground breaking design for an iron skeleton to support the Statue of Liberty. He is made an honorary citizen of the USA in recognition for his achievements. Claire (Armande Boulanger) Gustave's daughter. Gustave's wife is dead and Claire wants to marry the young kid who is working in Gustave's office. Afterward, he considers what his next construction should be, for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. Two of his employees, Maurice Koechlin (JÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©rÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©my Lopez) and ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â‰mile Nouguier (Damien Zanoly), propose a 200-meter (656-foot) steel tower, but he turns down their proposal, favoring a Metro system for Paris. In order to get publicity for his enterprise, he contacts an old friend, journalist Antoine De Restac (Pierre Deladonchamps). At a society party, Eiffel meets Restac's wife, Adrienne (Emma Mackey). They have a strange, instant connection. Transfixed by her (& her challenge to build something audacious for Paris), Eiffel suddenly announces he will build a 300-meter steel tower, shocking the other guests. It is clear that there is a history between Gustave and Adrienne.

Bordeaux, 1860 - While building an iron bridge over the treacherous River Garonne, Eiffel dives in to rescue a construction worker who fell into the river. Eiffel demands wood for safety scaffolding from his superiors, but his request is turned down. Eiffel goes to BourgÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¨s, a wealthy local businessman, to ask for the wood. Eiffel meets Adrienne, BourgÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¨s' headstrong daughter. Impressed by having secretly witnessed Eiffel's heroism on the bridge, she speaks up in defense of his request for the wood and secures it for him. Adrienne invites Eiffel to her birthday party. At the party, he is awkward, but she finds his aloofness attractive. He kisses her, then storms off, embarrassed. She shows up later at his office, saying she's attracted to him. Eiffel doesn't believe her and sends her away, so she throws herself into the river, to spite him. He rescues her and they make love and begin a passionate affair

1886 - Eiffel presents his plans for the tower to the judges for the competition. There are some concerns if the ground is too soft for this mammoth structure, but Gustave presents a new technique to provide a foundation for the tower near the riverbed. He explains how the tower will be built and the fact that it is wind resistant and impervious to lightening strikes. At the ceremony to announce the winner, as his name is announced, Eiffel and Adrienne instinctively hold hands. Restac sees this. Eiffel begins construction of the tower. At a garden party, he dances with Adrienne and asks her to meet him at a cheap hotel in the country. She refuses. As construction continues, the workers threaten to strike. Adrienne realizes Restac has become suspicious of her. She searches his things and finds a cartoon belittling Eiffel's tower. Out of jealousy, Restac is using his position as a top journalist to sabotage public opinion against the tower. Restac subtly warns Eiffel about this. With uncertainty clouding the whole undertaking, the workers at the tower go on strike. Bordeaux, 1860 - Eiffel learns Adrienne has left town and runs to her house, where her father tells Eiffel she was just stringing him along, and that she never wants to see him again.

1886 - Adrienne shows up at the cheap hotel. She reveals to Eiffel that the reason she left him 30 years ago was that she was pregnant with his child, and her parents forbade her to marry Eiffel, or ever see him again. She raced from the house to be with him, but as she tried to escape over the fence, she fell and was impaled on a spike, losing the baby and almost dying. Eiffel realizes Adrienne has always loved him and they make love. When the banks threaten to pull funding for the tower, Eiffel finances the tower with his own fortune. Seeing Eiffel is betting everything on the tower, the workers cease their strike. Gustave is a master engineer and uses an ingenious system of sand and air based hydraulics to ensure that the 4 pillars of the tower align at the first level. Adrienne visits the completed first level and she and Eiffel kiss above the rooftops of Paris.

Restac, who married Adrienne and nursed her back to health after her family abandoned her, is aware of her affair with Eiffel. He tells her he will ruin Eiffel's reputation and destroy the tower's chances of completion if she doesn't end the affair. Adrienne tells Eiffel she has agreed to leave the city with Restac, to protect Eiffel and his tower.

Furious and powerless, Eiffel, orders the tower's construction to be completed with rivets instead of bolts, so it can never be torn down. He pushes his team to exhaustion and finishes the tower in time for the World's Fair. At the grand opening, Eiffel sees Adrienne in the crowd. After they briefly make eye contact, she leaves, knowing she has sacrificed everything so his masterpiece can be completed. Returning to the opening scene, Eiffel writes in his journal in his office atop the tower. He sketches atop a diagram of the tower, adding letters beside it, to form the name Adrienne. It suddenly becomes apparent that the tower is in the shape of the capital letter ""A"". Eiffel has made the tower a permanent monument to their love. He walks out and surveys the city, which sprawls beneath him.",romance

Preston, Esq Alex Winter and Ted ""Theodore"" Logan Keanu Reeves. They went through time and Hell to create great music as the Wyld Stallyns, but after achieving big success at one point with multiple record albums, their music quality began to decline, and the world seemed to care less about them.

To this day, they have not written the song that will unite the world.In the present day, Bill and Ted are at a wedding to perform for Ted's younger brother Deacon Beck Bennett and Missy Amy Stoch, who married both Bill and Ted's dads first. The guys play a mishmash of instruments in their attempts to create their big song, but it just sounds bad, and Ted's elderly dad Jonathan Hal Landon Jr. thinks Bill and Ted are just washed up losers who waste their time and have been poor role models to their daughters, while also saying that their wives, Princess Joanna, ""Jo"" Jayma Mays and Princess Elizabeth, ""Liz"" Erinn Hayes, are the only real adults in their families, but Billie and Thea still believe in their dads.Liz and Jo bring their husbands to couples therapy, even though the intention was to do it separately. They talk to Dr. Wood Jillian Bell, where it is apparent that Bill and Ted can't do anything without each other, even tell their own wives ""I love you"". Liz and Jo admit that while they love their husbands, they do feel that the two are just going through are a routine that they can't grow out of.Bill and Ted go home feeling upset over how they are viewed, with Ted even thinking of selling his Les Paul guitar to make money. Suddenly, an eggshaped time machine appears. Out steps Kelly Kristen School, the daughter of the guys' previous timetravel guide Rufus who had apparently passed away some years earlier. Kelly tells Bill and Ted that they need to go with her. Billie and Thea watch as their dads hop in the time machine. The guys are taken  years into the future in San Dimas, California where Kelly brings them to meet her mom, The Great Leader Holland Taylor. She explains to the guys that since they still haven't written the song that will unite the world, and worse still time and reality have begun bending in an event called ""The Unraveling"", and if the guys can't produce the song within less than  minutes  PM specifically, reality is doomed. Kelly gives them a pocket watch from her father that will keep track of time in San Dimas. Bill and Ted know they won't have enough time, so they decide to try and go into their own futures to steal the song from themselves when they think they have already written it. They hop inside their old time traveling phone booth and head out.The guys end up in  to find their future selves are performing at a lounge for people who aren't even listening to them.

tt15206378," women find themselves dealing with a mystery killing. Who's the killer and what are the motives of the murder? A young woman named Susanna Diana Del Bufalo returns to her countryside home from Milan on the occasion of Christmas, as her family is supposed to spend a few days together. The first person she meets back at home is the new maid who came  months ago, Maria Luisa Ranieri, who rather coldly welcomes Susanna home and makes acquaintance with her. Gradually the rest of the characters are introduced as family members make their appearances. The family is headed by Susanna's father, Marcello Luca Pastorelli, and her mother, Margherita Margherita Buy. Margherita's elderly mother, Rachele Ornella Vanoni, and her spinster sister, Agostina Sabrina Impacciatore, have been living in the house for many years now, despite having moved in for a short stay originally. Perhaps the only family member most excited to have Susanna back is her younger sister Caterina Benedetta Porcaroli, who is also the youngest individual in the house. Noticing that Marcello is nowhere to be seen yet, Susanna asks to go meet him and learns that the man is still in his private bedroom, owing to the fact that he is not very well. After catching up with the rest of the family members, Susanna, Caterina, Rachele, Margherita, and Agostina all have breakfast while Maria serves them. After this, the maid takes breakfast for Marcello up to his room. Her shrieks, and then her reporting to the rest of the family, confirm that Marcello has been murdered inside his very room, with a knife stabbed into his back.The six women inside Marcello's grand house are stuck inside after the man's murder is discovered, for there is a blinding snowstorm raging outside. The women try to contact the police to report the murder but realize that the telephone lines have been cut. One of them thinks of driving away from the house but realizes that the car has also been tampered with, as wires under its hood are all cut up. Later on, Maria decides that she will leave the house on foot, but soon has to run back in and report that the main gate of the house has also been bolted shut by someone. Naturally, all the characters are sure that the murderer is among them, and this situation further complicates when a seventh woman, Veronica Micaela Ramazzotti, walks into the house. This new woman, who had actually been a longtime lover of Marcello, informs that she had been called up by some woman from the house who had told her something had happened to her lover and asked her to rush to the house.Each of the characters has their own secrets, which get revealed as the film progresses. Rachele, is introduced as someone who is unable to walk from the beginning of the film, as she needs to be pushed around in a wheelchair. However, this is later revealed to be her pretense of getting extra help and sympathy from everyone around, and she is actually able to walk very easily. Rachele is obsessed with her stocks, which are the only remaining wealth that she has. The woman always keeps the papers for these stocks under her bed, ensuring that they are always safe. A little while after the murder is discovered, these stocks are found to be missing, too, making Rachele suspect that one of the other women had not only killed her soninlaw but had also stolen all her money.nNext is Rachele's younger daughter and Margherita's sister Agostina, whose biggest complaint in life seems to be that no man has loved her till now. Agostina is revealed to have dearly loved Marcello, and she used to desire the man, too, despite the fact that he was married to her elder sister. Agostina had made multiple attempts to present her romantic thoughts to Marcello, but the man always avoided her advances in any way he could. Marcello himself was no less than a Casanova, as he had multiple lovers throughout his life, one of which was the new maid, Maria. The house used to have a different older maid earlier, who had strangely died one day after falling while she was cleaning the windows.nMaria had come into the house after this, as her sister used to work at a family house acquainted with Marcello's family and had subsequently fallen in love with the rich man. Margherita had no idea about this, but she, too, was tired of her married life since there was no love left between the couple. It is later revealed that Margherita was having an affair with Marcello's biggest business associate at the time, Sir Giannutri.On the other hand, Marcello always had a lover in his life named Veronica, even before he had been married to Margherita, and he kept in touch with Veronica even in presentday times. She had had to share her past lover Marcello, and her house with Margherita, since the house in which the latter and her husband lived was actually the family house of Veronica. But as fate would have it, Veronica also has to share her present lover with Margherita, for she, too, has been having an affair with Sir Giannutri.nMargherita's elder daughter, Susanna, has more than one secret of her own, one of which is a shock and surprise to her too. At present, she is pregnant with a child from her lover in Milan, and she keeps this news away from the family; this is soon revealed after some time. However, at this time, she learns that she is not the biological daughter of Marcello, whom she has always known to be her father, but was instead conceived by Margherita with a lover out of wedlock. It was while Margherita was pregnant with Susanna that she first met Marcello, who fell in love with her and married her soon after. Marcello needed Margherita's family fortune to buy his dream house.nLastly, there is the younger sister, Caterina, but she does not seem to have any secrets or anything suspicious about her, except for the fact that she locks up her father's room after the discovery of his murder, stating that nobody should damage the crime scene before the police arrive. But as things turned out, Caterina had the biggest secret of them all.Through a series of confrontations among the characters, it is revealed that each of them had met with Marcello the previous night without letting the others know. The man had gotten into some financial trouble in recent times, for which he had asked for help from Rachele, knowing that she had stocks on her. But Rachele met with him the night before and told him that she was unwilling to help him by parting with her life's savings. Agostina tried twice to enter Marcello's room and tell him about a love letter she had written for him, but the man managed to avoid her both times. Maria did go meet him with his midnight tea, and this was a pleasant meeting for the man for a change, as he was in love with her. Margherita had visited to tell her husband of something she had been planning for quite some time nowMargherita wanted to leave Marcello and had been preparing to do so by the end of the year. On the previous night, she had told him of her decision, apparently causing more stress for the man. Next came Veronica, who had a key to the house and Marcello's room owing to the fact that she had always been his constant lover. But now, she asked for money from Marcello, telling him that she wants to go to Paris and will return his money later.Susanna, who had apparently only come from Milan on this particular morning, had actually returned from Milan the previous night itself, for she wanted to tell her father of her pregnancy. She met him last, after all the previous meetings and asked for forgiveness and acceptance from her father. It seems that all these women had met Marcello for their own personal benefits and wellbeing. Even Susanna had similar intentions as she basically wanted her father to leave money for his grandchild in his will. Marcello had indeed been preparing a will, and he was probably all the more confused after this peculiar night. It was Caterina who played an instrumental role and helped her father ease his stress. The young woman had been hiding behind curtains and witnessed all of the meetings and understood how each of the women was trying to make use of Marcello. Taking this realization to her father, she helped the man prepare a unique plan. Marcello wanted to play dead and pretend that he had been murdered and then check how the women reacted to such a situation. This way, he believed, he would be able to understand who all genuinely loved him. He had made the two women he trusted the most at present part of this schemehis daughter Caterina and his lover Maria. It was these two women who had then set the whole scene, cut off all communications, and also called Veronica onto the scene. At the end it is revealed that there was no murderer at all, for Marcello had not been killed and was very much alive in his room. This was the reason, Caterina explains, that she had locked up the room immediately after the discovery so that the father would not have to play dead for long.Following all the confrontations and reactions that followed among the women after the discovery of the fake murder, Caterina is sure that the five have shown their true colors. Instead of grieving for the loss of the man from their lives, the women got busy with figuring out the murderer and finding out who would get Marcello's property. With all the revelations and these moral evaluations made, it is time for Marcello to step out from his hiding. Caterina opens up his room, and the six others rush in, only to find it empty. The open terrace door makes it clear that the man must have gone there, but more twist follows when the seven women reach the terrace. Marcello seems to have either slipped or jumped off the terrace onto the ground, on which he now lays, motionless and dead. The women now finally inform the police, who arrive on the scene, and they report it as Marcello having committed suicide. Caterina, who does not protest such reporting, is now told by the rest of the women that she should always stick to helping women instead of working against them. She asks whether that should be the case even if a man asks her to work against women, and her mother reassuringly tells her that should indeed be the case.Perhaps Marcello must have slipped and fallen to his death but having to report that to the police would also mean that everything else needed to be said. Instead, the women chose to say that the man had killed himself due to his recent financial struggles and move on with their lives. The patriarch was now dead, and there was no threat to any of the women's lives either. All seven of the women could live together off his wealth and have no conflict among each other, as is suggested by them at the end.",comedy

tt11314148,"The film starts with the marriage of Gautam, an Indian Foreign Services officer, and Ira, a spirited social worker. Jaggi, a rank guest at the wedding, creates a scene and gets caught with his friends for gatecrashing the party. Jaggi later crosses the border illegally, intending to reach London but gets caught and taken back to the embassy where Gautam works. Jaggi explains to him that he has to reach London before Monday to his love, being inspired by Gautam's speech. The film flashes back to three months ago.

Jaggi, a hockey player, meets Kartika, a swimmer, and though the two get off to a rocky start, they start spending time together, teaching each other their sport. After a party, they have sex. Jaggi later learns that Kartika is getting married and asks why she didn't tell him. She replies that she was betrothed before meeting him and is sorry. He tells her that he truly loves her and she tells him that if his feelings are true, he should come to London after three months, in which case she will cancel the wedding. He tries to apply for a visa but fails to get one, and thus tries to go illegally.

After listening to Jaggi's story, Gautam admits that his philosophy was just a reception speech. Ira and Gautam are currently separated as Gautam had exposed to the government that a young boy selling food on the street was a refugee staying illegally. Ira, who felt sympathy for the boy, argued with Gautam over this and left him.

Jaggi has to be deported to India. He tries to escape, but gets caught when he suffers injuries while saving his fellow traveler Bilal. Due to some problem in documentation, Jaggi's flight is missed. Gautam has to keep Jaggi with him for 2 days till the next flight on Monday morning. On the way back home, Jaggi sees the other side of the English Channel and asks Gautam what lies on the other side. Listening to Gautam's reply, Jaggi gets excited and laughs that he can swim and cross the sea. Both spend some time enjoying, and on the way, Jaggi sees a dress and wishes to buy it for Kartika. For the first time in 3 months, ultimately, he finally calls Kartika to enquire about her dress size. She is shocked to hear Jaggi's voice. He says that he is in France and will try to reach there before Monday. She doesn't believe him and thinks he is joking, but her phone battery drains out before they can speak further. The next day, Jaggi persuades Gautam to make a step to his relationship and calls Ira, who wishes to talk it out. At the restaurant, Ira instead asks for divorce and tells Gautam to sign the papers. He angrily signs the papers and leaves. On the way home, Jaggi sees a swimsuit and desires to swim the English Channel wearing that swimsuit. Angry, Gautam takes Jaggi to a swimming pool and makes him swim continuously, believing that as the English Channel is 20 miles long it would be nearly suicidal to cover the entire length by swimming.

The next day, Gautam is surprised to find Ira at his doorstep, and realizes that Jaggi, who has gone missing, is responsible for having made the call to her. Jaggi leaves behind a letter, stating that he will try to reunite with Kartika, no matter what. He then enters the sea in order to reach the other side of the United Kingdom. Here, Gautam and Ira try to find him out but they fail. Kartika is also concerned for him because Jaggi called her from a P.C.O. and claimed that he is coming for her through the channel.

Jaggi swims long as he can go, but starts losing energy by the middle of the sea, and faints. He is saved by some strangers. Gautam informs Kartika that Jaggi is safe and that he tried to cross English Channel in order to reach her. He asks her if she would have really broken off her marriage in the event that Jaggi would have crossed the sea, but she is confused and doesn't have an answer. Seeing Jaggi's intense love for her, she falls in love with him. She confesses her feelings to Jaggi on phone and demands that he pick her up fast.

Seeing the love between the two, Gautam helps Jaggi get a passport with a United Kingdom visa illegally. When Ira asks Gautam why he is risking his career for Jaggi, he admits that he felt guilty since Jaggi was willing to go to unimaginable lengths to reunite with his love but he himself wasn't. For the last time, Jaggi goes to meet Bilal and tells him everything.

At the last moment when Gautam and Jaggi are about to board the plane, Bilal betrays Jaggi to the cops in return for a job, a house and legal citizenship. Seeing the police in search of him, Jaggi hides at the bottom of the plane.

At the end, it is shown that Gautam and Ira reunited back and Gautam was telling Jaggi's love story to his friends as they were remembering him, as he concludes saying that everyone has a story of love, and the only common factor binding them is the intensity of that love.",romance

The younger of Larry and Marion McPherson's (Tracy Letts, Laurie Metcalf) two children, Christine outwardly hates most of the aspects of her life: She hates that they have long endured an existence of barely scraping by, and their situation is even worse now in the poor economy that has led to Larry being laid off and Marion needing to work double shifts as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital just to keep their heads above water, and Christine's big brother Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues) and his girlfriend Shelly Yuhan (Marielle Scott) moving back into the McPhersons' small, already-overcrowded house with one bathroom now for five people. She hates that what her parents have decided to spend on her within their already tight budget is an expensive Catholic private-school education at Immaculate Heart, solely because Miguel witnessed long ago some violence outside Sacramento High School, where she would have gone otherwise.

Marcus has tension with her family because her father Harold Robert Wisdom doesn't particularly like him, and he also has issues with Emily's brother Gabe Andrew Bachelor because Marcus punched him in the face one time.Later that night, Ron and Kyla come crashing through the gate of the venue and pretend to angrily confront Marcus and Emily for not inviting them, before they burst out laughing at the gag.

Meanwhile, Harold expresses to Emily and Kyla that he didn't get along with his own fatherinlaw, and Emily notes the same thing is happening with him and Marcus.

Marcus starts to trip balls almost instantly, so Ron eats one mushroom to help him. The two space out until Marcus is pounced on by what he believes is a fox attacking him. He nearly grabs a knife to kill it until Ron stops him to point out Harold and his group, revealing that the ""fox"" was actually Harold's dog playfully pouncing on Marcus. Harold tries to approach Marcus with respectful intents, but Marcus's hallucinations make him see Harold as a clown, and is unable to stop laughing. Ron steps in and saves him by saying that he knows Marcus wants nothing more than to make a good impression on Harold.Ron later joins Marcus as they go golfing against Gabe and his buddy Bennet Kamal Bolden, while Kyla continues to hang out with Emily and her family. Emily gets nervous because Kyla is giving ""special"" medicine to her Grandma Phyllis Denise Burse, who is typically quiet and doesn't move around too much because of her condition. While on the golf course, Ron appears super drunk and they keep missing every hole they come across. In the middle of the game, Ron takes out a lot of money, which he reveals he got from pawning off Marcus and Emily's wedding rings.

Ron pulls off an impressive swing on the last hole to get a hole in one.The guys go to the pawnshop just before it closes, and Marcus gets the rings back. Ron sees a bird flying overhead, and because he earlier told Marcus that he knows when a bird is going to poop, he pushes Marcus out of the way just before he gets crapped on...and this causes Marcus to drop the rings down the sewer. He begins to freak out on Ron for causing all of this, and Ron starts telling Marcus that he helped Kyla conceive a child after doctors told him that he is sterile, seemingly confirming that Marcus really is the father of Kyla's child.That night, the family hosts a party, where Marcus's construction buddies show up after being invited by Ron. Ron and Kyla then go up on stage to announce to everyone how Marcus has lent a hand in helping them have a baby. Before Kyla can finish her sentence, Marcus tries to own up to it himself and declare to everyone that he is the father of Kyla's baby after they had the drugfueled sexual encounter. It actually turns out that this is not the case  after the couples did their cliff dive, Ron thinks that the impact the water landing had on his balls caused him to undo his infertility, and so he successfully impregnated Kyla. Emily stands up to admit that it was she who had sex with Kyla, and they were just on top of Marcus, who wasn't involved in it. Harold angrily berates Marcus, who then reveals that he lost the rings. When Gabe tries to berate him too, Marcus punches him in the face again. A brawl then breaks out between Gabe's friends and Marcus's construction buddies, and Marcus leaves dejectedly. On the way out, Ron and Kyla try to talk to Marcus and Emily, but the two of them snap at the other couple and say that they were never friends and deliberately avoided keeping in touch with them because of how crazy they are.

Harold then comes in with the construction guys, all of them very drunk. Harold has loosened up and admits to Marcus that he has been hard on him, but he is willing to give him another chance, which Marcus accepts. Emily is then visited by Grandma Phyllis, who is now able to walk thanks to the medicine Kyla gave her. She gives Emily a note and gift from Kyla, which is an apology to her and Marcus for ruining their wedding, but also an admission that the two of them felt like their best friends in forever, especially because Ron's own best friend passed away and he didn't meet another guy like that until Marcus came along. In the box is the wedding rings that Ron spent all day fishing out of the sewers. Marcus and Emily feel really bad and set off to go find Ron and Kyla.Emily remembers that Kyla mentioned she and Ron like to go to Waffle House, so she and Marcus go to multiple Waffle Houses until they eventually find Ron and Kyla. Although the two are still upset with Marcus and Emily, the latter two apologize, and Marcus kisses Ron's forehead, which he had earlier said is the ultimate sign of respect. They forgive Marcus and Emily, and they still want to name their baby after Marcus. They agree to go to the wedding on the condition that Marcus and Emily go to theirs.Months later, Marcus and Emily return to the cave in Mexico along with both their families and Baby Marcus to watch Ron and Kyla get married.

tt19755170,"A smalltown man who falls in love with the most beautiful girl in town. He wants to marry her one day because marrying her can raise his social position.Ajay Dixit Varun Dhawan is a History teacher but is embarrassed that he hasn't achieved more in life, and that is why he has lied to everyone he knows that he fell behind due to circumstances. He could have been a cricketer if not for his tennis elbow; he could have been an IAS officer but wanted to teach kids to be IAS instead; or he fell sick right before an important exam, which is why he is now teaching history instead of already being a part of it. These are some of the lies he has told around the whole town to ""maintain an image."" Ajay loves his image in town and wants to protect it at all costs.nThe Principal Shashie Vermaa of the school gets several complaints from fellow teachers who believe Ajay is a fake, but due to lack of any evidence, the Principal does not take any action.nAjay also lives with his parents and buys expensive items to maintain his aura in town. His dad refuses to fund his lavish lifestyle.Ajay married Nisha Janhvi Kapoor some nine months ago, but he has never liked her. Nisha told him before they got married that she had epilepsy, but since she hadn't had a fit in over ten years, Ajay decided it wasn't a problem for him. Ajay married Nisha because he thought she would help him enhance his image. While Nisha selected Ajay as she saw him as friendly and compassionate, not knowing that it was only his image.nHowever, on the day of their marriage, she had a fit, and since then, Ajay has been disappointed in her because he is embarrassed about other people finding out. He doesn't let her work a job or even take her anywhere because he is scared of what people will think of him if she has a fit again. Nisha has not left him because she has some hope.One morning in school, when he is in a particularly bad mood, he slaps one of his students Atul Nikhil Chawla for asking him a question related to the subject. Atul wanted to know why prisoners were stripped of their clothes before being taken to gas chambers in concentration camps. When Ajay couldn't answer, Atul mocked him for not knowing, hence prompting the slap.That gets him into trouble because the boy is the MLA's Vishwas Raghuvanshi Mukesh Tiwari son, and he gets involved. Ajay is suspended for a few days, and he could potentially lose his job, which he cannot afford because he wants to keep up his image.nTherefore, he comes up with a plan to go on a tour of Europe and visit all the places relevant to World War II so that he can teach the kids about them through a livestream, covering up the fact of his incompetence in the classroom. He plans on taking Nisha with him so that his father Mr Dixit Manoj Pahwa will agree to finance the trip, but he tells her that it is only for show, and he is not actually interested in their relationship.nWhen Nisha thanks Ajay, he retorts that he only included her so that his father would fund the trip. He actually wants Nisha to go to her home from the airport and meet him only once he returns.A fedup Nisha decides not to put up with his nonsense anymore and to go to Europe regardless. He could go his way, and she would do what she wanted. Unfortunately, though, things immediately go wrong for Ajay, and his bag is exchanged with another man Kalpesh Vyas Hemang, leaving Ajay with terrible clothes for the duration of his trip. He is also not able to figure out his day and how to go about the city, while Nisha goes on to have an excellent time. When they get back to the hotel, Ajay sees this and understands that he needs her help to navigate Europe, and Nisha agrees, saying that she isn't going to abandon him the way he did to her.Since Ajay is shameless and Nisha is a pushover, this couple sets out to explore the city, and it is Nisha who tells Ajay the facets of history that he then starts relaying to his students. Nisha narrates stories like how the people of Paris left their city when Hitler arrived, so that he would not ruin their beautiful city. But they cut the cables of the Eiffel tower, so he could not view the city from above.nThey hire an audio guide for  euros and relive the harrowing first hour of Omaha beach at Normandy on June th, . , soldiers died.nThey visit the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam.Nisha really comes through for Ajay by getting his mobile phone back from a thief, settling a fight, and even showing her resourcefulness by cooking food with the hot water from the bathroom. Ajay starts seeing Nisha as a person instead of someone he used to tolerate in his house. They start coming closer every day, and Ajay even starts getting possessive over her.nBack in Lucknow, his videos on history are a hit and are gaining good attention, despite the MLA insisting that a committee be set up to decide on his suspension.When a video of Ajay dancing with Nisha is uploaded by her on her social media page, it goes viral, and Ajay is furious since he believes that it could hurt his chances with his job. In his anger, he says some really mean things to her, and Nisha finally decides to leave him behind and sign the divorce papers back home.Ajay visits a Berlin Museum, where he sees the last things that the people grabbed before they were scurried away to concentration camps. When he imagines himself in their situation, he realizes that Nisha means something to him, and he asks her to stay back for the rest of the trip instead of leaving midway. Nisha agrees. This is just another undeserved chance for Ajay.nWhen they are in Auschwitz, they meet a concentration camp survivor who tells them how he should have paid more attention to his wife. Ajay relates this to his own situation, and this is what it took for him to learn to see Nisha as a person instead of a ""misfire,"" as he called her and their marriage.nThis time, when she has a fit, he is there for her and really takes care of her.Ajay returns to India and tells the committee that he was never a good teacher and will accept whatever verdict they have reached. To his surprise, the committee decided in his favor because when they conducted a test for the students, they all aced it, thanks to Ajay's history lessons from Europe.nNow that Ajay is a changed man, he has the respect of the MLA and the approval of all of his students, meaning that he is going to live his life as a changed person with the help of his wife.",romance

tt6166392,"A ship sails towards land and a young Willy Wonka stands on top of a mast, singing a song and when the ship ports in dock, Willy continues singing, but gives away all but 1 of his silver coins, the last of which he drops down a drain. Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called ""Tiddles"" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.

Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.

That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.

The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a ""little orange man with green hair"" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an ""N"" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.

One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.

The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.

The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an ""A"" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.

The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the ""zoo"", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the ""N"" is actually a ""Z"", which belonged to his brother ""Zebbedy"" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.

Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.

Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.

As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.",comedy

Having no recollection of her mother, high school outcast Maren plucks up the courage to embark on a long, challenging journey to find her. Instead, as Maren struggles to understand, facing her well-hidden adolescent longings on the fringes of Ronald Reagan-era America, a chance encounter with enigmatic pariah and handsome soulmate Lee gives voice to the unspoken expectations of first love. Now, uneasy feelings and all-consuming impulses take over, and the raw, visceral need for companionship and connection in an indifferent society brings to light the wild side of humankind. More than anything, Maren wants to come to terms with her past to find her place in the world. But what's it like to give in to love, bones and all? In 1980s Virginia, teenager Maren Yearly bites through a girl's finger-partially severing it-at a sleepover. She and her single father, Frank, swiftly relocate to Maryland.

On the tape, Frank recounts the story of Maren's first cannibalistic episode, when she killed her babysitter at three years old. Similar incidents continued to occur over the years and while Frank helped her evade consequence, he anguished over Maren's lack of remorse. He concludes with the hope that she will overcome her urges.Maren heads to Minnesota, where her mother, Janelle, of whom she has no memories, was born. She takes a bus to Columbus, Ohio, where she encounters Sully, an eccentric man and fellow ""eater"" who found her by scent. She follows Sully to a house wherein an elderly woman is near death.

During a brief stay in Lee's hometown in Kentucky, Maren notices his unwillingness to discuss his father's absence and the reason why Lee avoids being spotted around town. His younger sister, Kayla, who is unaware of his true nature, chastises him for his constant departures.Maren and Lee encounter what appears to be a pair of fellow eaters, Jake and Brad. Maren is revolted at the fact that Brad does not share their cravings, instead voluntarily choosing to engage in cannibalism.

Once she and Lee have feasted on the body, Maren expresses guilt upon discovering that the man was married and had a family.Using a phone book directory, Maren finds the home of her grandmother, Barbara, who had no prior knowledge of her existence. Barbara confesses that she and her husband adopted Janelle at birth and that Janelle has since voluntarily admitted herself into a psychiatric hospital in Fergus Falls.Maren meets Janelle, who has self-cannibalized her own hands. Maren reads a letter that Janelle wrote to her, which concludes with Janelle's belief that Maren would be better off dead. Janelle attacks Maren, but is restrained by a nurse.

Once Lee realizes Maren is gone, he decides to return home.After some time, Maren returns to Kentucky. While there, she runs into Kayla who tells her that, on the night of her and Lee's alcoholic, abusive father's disappearance, he beat both of his children and vanished while Kayla ran to get the police. Initially considered the prime suspect, Lee was cleared of involvement when it was proven that the blood on him was his own. After Maren is reunited with Lee, they rekindle their relationship and travel westward.

tt7453138,"The movie opens with footage of Stephen talking about his experience about what happened with the companion he met. At intervals more sessions of the footage are shown during the movie.

Stephen (Steve) is a withdrawn 40-year something single man, shy and in desperate need of a companion. At the suggestion of his open-minded colleague Nick, who poses him direct questions about his personal life, Stephen goes out to find a prostitute. He picks a young and attractive one and offers her $20 for a hand job. The girl does it coldly and he doesn't seem to enjoy it and at one point she asks him what's wrong with him since he doesn't get hard. He handles her another $30 for a blow job but it proves unsuccessful too. He takes her back to the point where he picked her.

Steve then opens with Nick regarding his experience. Nick is amused he gave it a try and he suggests he should try the girlfriend experience. At first Stephen is again reluctant but then he goes out for the hunt. Near a diner he spots a hooker whom he instantly likes and asks her to be his companion. When asked her name she says 'Candy'. They dine and talk about their personal lives and pays her fee accordingly. Before he leaves her he asks to meet again.

On their second appointment Candy takes him to a horror house which she knew the owner. Stephen looks perplexed and even frightened; yet he states to Candy 'it's OK'.

On their next appointment Stephen asks for the girlfriend experience. Candy lays out the rules to which Stephen finds no objections. He takes her out near an airfield laying on the ground watching stars and planes. Meanwhile discussions about personal lives continue getting deeper.

On another appointment Stephen takes her home. He pays a fee for sex however even when Candy asks explicitly to make sex he refuses and says he just wants to stay next to her in bed. Candy is amused, even goes far as asking if he is gay.

Subsequent sequences shows they are getting along well while doing various social activities.

The pick-up place is generally the diner he saw her the first time.

Meanwhile Steve keeps talking to Nick about what he's doing and about his feelings and Nick warns him prostitution is like a business transaction - you should not get attracted to.

Steve feels strongly attracted to her and thinks about taking some vacation days to take her for a holiday. Candy is amused with this but says no-one can refuse a free holiday. He asks Blaze, his superior for some days off and Blaze makes it difficult for him. Stephen protests saying he rarely took days off, is always punctual and has always been loyal. Blaze tells him to sign a paper and will talk to the top management and should be OK. However Blaze after tells Steve he regrets management has refused his off days request. A furious Steve insults him in front of all work team. Soon Blaze is back with a security officer and Steve is fired from work.

He meets Candy at home and tells her he cannot take her on holiday and cannot even keep dating due to having been made redundant. Candy confesses that she is in love with him, so much that has not seen anyone else except him since they met, and that she has taken a job at the diner they always met by. She reveals her true name to the now emotional Stephen, 'Christa Sullivan' and tells him also her address. Not only, she gives him a part of the money he paid her so far promising to give him the rest gradually. She had fallen in love with him too.

Candy (now Christa) asks him for sex to which Steve now is fully prepared. She tells her to wait a minute to go to the bathroom before. While waiting for her Steve falls asleep. Waking up and seeing Christa is not near him he checks the bathroom and find Christa has died from an overdose. She was a junky. A devastated Stephen lays her next to him on the bed.

Suddenly Stephen and Christa are talking, however the talking is cut by a separate scene showing Christa has really died and Steve was just imagining.

The movie keeps cutting between Steve's imagination and the real situation, with Steve gradually even making love to the corpse.

One day a neighbour rings the door bell and asks Steve about the awful smell coming from his home; Steve tells that while doing basement works he accidentally hit a sewer pipe and is going to be fixed soon. Meanwhile the movie keeps switching between Steve's discussions in his imaginations and the gruesome situation in his house showing the gradual decomposition of Christa.

One day Christa tells Steve he soon won't be able to hug her etc. anymore, implying she will rot in pieces and suggests him that to be really together he must also die. Steve asks how he should die, whether jumping from a building or something else as long as it's not cutting his veins from which he is terrified. Christa suggests he uses the pistol she always had in her bag for security and die by shouting in his mouth while they are having sex and when they are climaxing together. He likes the idea, and a sequence showing intense missionary sex starts. Meanwhile police are heard at the door; as revealed later a neighbour has spied through the window following the smell. Just before they are climaxing police break in and Steve doesn't make it in time to kill himself.

Steve is now confined to some mental asylum/hospital from where the footage we see at intervals was recorded. It is now revealed 'Nick' was also an imaginary colleague.

Movie ends with Steve reflecting in silence that maybe cutting the veins would not have been a bad idea.",romance

tt8851148,"""Some things are beyond repair."" The In Between (2022) by writer, Marc Klein, is a supernatural Love Story about an aspiring photographer, ""Tessa"" (Joey King) desperately trying to make contact with ""Skylar"" (Kyle Allen), the boyfriend who died in a car accident (and seems to be trying to get her attention). Via poignant time-line clips, the story follows the grief-stricken Tessa on a backwards journey of reflection from waking up in the hospital (after the accident) to replaying memories of their sweet summer romance. Throughout all this, Skylar's persistent and obvious attempts to let Tessa know he's near, gradually succeed in crossing the line between heaven and earth and into a desperate embrace with the woman he loves and misses. It's a little scary and intense, but this is the moment Tessa has been hoping for. She and Skylar are once again together-Tessa being in a coma--and she must now choose between life on earth and spending eternity with Skylar. What we also see in this heartfelt and suspenseful romance is a masterful execution of romance-film conventions that pull us into the intimate bonding stages of this believable and budding relationship, while subtly tugging at our own emotions and beliefs of the afterlife. It's clever how Tessa's photography-which she never thinks is good enough for others to see--is cleverly woven as both the film's romantic motif as well as Tessa's other passion for living. And though the ending may seem predictable, the narrative has enough emotional twists and turns to make you guess otherwise.",romance

tt4411584,"A feature film adaptation of the self-help book, 'The Secret', which focuses on the power of positive thinking. Based on the groundbreaking best-selling book by Rhonda Byrne, The Secret: Dare to Dream follows Miranda (Katie Holmes), a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell). A devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, Bray (Josh Lucas), into Miranda's life. Bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to Miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. With its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, The Secret: Dare to Dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.Ã‚Â—Lionsgate. The movie opens on a woman, Miranda Wells, shopping among the fishermen at the docks for her boss/boyfriend's seafood restaurant. She delivers the fish and crabs to the restaurant and is reminded that she has a dentist appointment. Her boss/boyfriend, Tucker Middendorf, reveals to her that he needs to postpone their dinner plans for that evening due to the need to board up the restaurant since a tropical storm/hurricane is approaching their area. At the dentist's office she is told she has some big cavities and needs a root canal, which is very expensive and well beyond her current means. After leaving the dentist she receives a call from Bobbi, who we learn later is her former mother-in-law, who expresses a desire that she go someplace safe since she doesn't think her home is sturdy enough to withstand the storm. Miranda's dialogue throughout all these scenes make it clear she has a very negative outlook on life and constantly expects the worst.In the meantime, we see a man named Bray Johnson check into a local hotel. We see him later at Miranda's home where he meets her son Greg who is fishing while he is home from school. Bray was intending to give Miranda an envelope but says he will bring it back later because it requires explanation. A short time later Miranda has picked up her daughters Chloe and Missy from school. She gets into an argument with Missy and is distracted enough that she rear-ends Brays pickup. His truck isn't hurt but her minivan has minor damage that Bray offers to fix. They don't introduce themselves to each other right away but when he follows her home he realizes who she is. He decides not to give her the envelope right away and fixes the minivan with Greg's help. As he is visiting with Miranda and her children it becomes apparent Bray has a much brighter outlook on life and proffers the idea to the group that much of what happens to us in life is a result of our expectations and our belief that good things will happen. The children had asked for pizza for supper but Miranda had told them that they couldn't afford it but just at that moment a pizza delivery, sent by Tuck, arrives. The predicted wind and rains from the storm start just as Bray is leaving. He decides to put the envelope in Miranda's mailbox instead of giving it to her in person.During the storm in the night the mailbox is blown away and a large limb falls thru Miranda's roof. She and the children huddle together in the bathroom til the morning when they can assess the damage. Bray returns to make sure she got the envelope and sees the mailbox is gone and also all the damage to the home. He again offers his assistance in repairing the roof since he has time before he has to return to his job teaching engineering at Vanderbilt university. Miranda says she can't afford a new roof but Bray outlines a clear plan to fix the major damage that will cost less than a tenth of what she expected so she agrees. Bobbi arrives and it's clear she sees Bray as an interloper that might interfere with her hope that Miranda marry Tucker. Bobbi knows Miranda is in quite a bit of debt and she expresses to Miranda that Tucker is a good-looking man, a dependable provider and obviously cares for her very much. She takes Miranda and the children to her home to stay while Bray completes repairs. They visit Tuck\'s restaurant and tell him they will be staying at Bobbi's while the house is being repaired. Tucker is curious about the stranger who is repairing the roof so he visits and talks briefly with Bray. Bray makes it clear he has no romantic intentions toward Miranda and is merely helping out because he has the skills and opportunity. We also see Bray have a conversation with a woman who is obviously expecting him to return home soon. That evening Miranda goes for a walk and calls Bray, She expresses uncertainty on how to deal with many things in her life and Bray shares the idea that if she keeps a positive outlook things will eventually become clear. The next day he finishes the roof and has a conversation with MIssy regarding her sixteenth birthday party that gives Missy a much-improved outlook on her own situation. As a result Missy demands that he come to her party the next day, which results in him postponing his departure again.That night at the restaurant's reopening Tucker proposes to Miranda and she accepts. The children are obviously unhappy about the situation but Bobbi is elated. Miranda's reaction seems measured and not overly excited, almost as if she's unsure about it. The children go home with Bobbi again while Miranda and Tucker spend the night together. The next morning Tucker has a brand new vehicle delivered to his apartment as a gift for Miranda. Miranda is appreciative but leaves hurriedly shortly after this, once again not being overly affectionate toward Tucker. At the same time, Bray returns to the house to pick up his tools and has an interaction with Greg and helps him perfect an invention Greg had hoped would help their family make money. That evening at Missy's party Bobbi shows Miranda a file she got from Google that shows Bray with an invention that Miranda's dead husband, Matthew, had previously worked on, talked about and tried to patent. When Miranda confronts Bray with this information he tells her he didn't steal Matthew's invention. He tells the story of having met Matt at an engineering convention and having hit it off with him and being intrigued with some of Matthew's ideas. He tells Miranda he was in the plane next to Matt in the crash that killed him and since then he has been working to get the patent for the idea they discussed together. Miranda tells him to leave which he does.The next day a package is delivered to Miranda. It is a copy of the documents that Bray had originally intended to give Miranda several days before, before they were lost in the storm. Included is a large check for almost the exact amount of Miranda's current debt, which from reading the documents she realizes is probably the first of many to come. She meets with her children and tells them their father has managed to provide for them for a long time with his work before he died and that she couldn't be more proud of him. She also says that Tucker' proposal was a surprise so she hadn't prepared for it but now that she's had time to think she wants to know what they think. All three children express to her that she shouldn't marry Tuck because they don't think she loves him because they remember how in love she was with their father and what that looked like. They also say she should forgive Bray for not telling her upfront about knowing their dad because when Bray was around Miranda seemed happy. Later Miranda goes to the restaurant and breaks off the engagement with Tucker, returning his ring and new car. Tucker is sad but accepts this along with Miranda's resignation as restaurant manager. Later that day after returning from dinner in town with the kids, Greg spots their mailbox in a roadside pond. They retrieve it and find the documents that Bray had tried to give Miranda the day they met. It has a note in it that expresses his regrets for not having told her immediately who he was. The note also says ""Matt was a special man who loved his family dearly."" Miranda tells Bobbi and the children she plans to finish getting her nursing degree which she apparently quit to raise their family.Miranda decides to visit Bray in Tennessee but unbeknownst to her Bray has returned to Louisiana to see her on the same day. Miranda is met a Bray's door by a woman and at first it seems she will leave without saying anything, thinking the woman is a girlfriend. But Miranda decides to tell the woman ""Tell him Miranda stopped by"" at which point the woman lights up and tells her ""I'm his sister and he's in Louisiana at your house about right now."" Miranda and Bray have an all-night phone conversation as they drive back toward each other and they eventually meet at a roadside diner halfway between. Bray says meeting Bobbi at the house the night before gave him a chance to clear the air with her regarding any misunderstanding regarding ""stealing"" her son\'s invention. Sometime later we see Miranda's family, including Bobbi, at Bray's house at Christmas time. Bray has ostensibly left to help a neighbor fix a barn but soon after pulls into the yard pulling a horse trailer with a pony for Chloe, which she has repeatedly asked for throughout the film.",romance
tt10999120,"A musical version of Charles Dickens's story of a miserly misanthrope who is taken on a magical journey. A musical version of the classic Christmas story by Charles Dickens. A miserly man who treats everyone around him with terrible selfishness finds himself on a fantastical adventure into the three phases of time: past, present, and future, in order to discover how he ended up so miserable and alone. Each Christmas Eve, the Ghost of Christmas Present (Will Ferrell) selects one dark soul to be reformed by a visit from three spirits. But this season, he picked the wrong Scrooge. Clint Briggs (Ryan Reynolds) turns the tables on his ghostly host until Present finds himself reexamining his own past, present and future. For the first time, ""A Christmas Carol"" is told from the perspective of the ghosts in this hilarious musical twist on the classic Dickens tale.

Convinced that people can change, the benevolent Ghost of Christmas Present takes on a challenging mission: help heartless media consultant Clint Briggs see the error of his ways and become a force for good in the world. Instead, as the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Yet-To-Come pitch in and do their part, the Ghost of Christmas Present finds himself faced with an unforeseen complication. What happens if the irredeemable manipulator is incapable of change? But not really. This isn't Christmas Carol, it's a movie about the ability to stay redeemed long term. And doing it everyday, and then doing it again even if you fail occasionally. It's about the consequences of the choices we make and being aware of those before we hit ""send"". And it's a fun musical. All the haters out there, like movie critics, will wake up tomorrow and still be awful because some people really are unredeemable.

Christmas Present finds his target, in the reprehensible character, played by Ryan Reynolds, Clint Briggs. Clint's firm makes its wealth by creating negative attack adds and running offensive click bait on social media. But Clint's real theme is his belief that people never really change. Christmas Present wants to prove Clint wrong. But not to save Clint. Turns out Christmas Present (spoiler alert) is the original unredeemable Scrooge himself, who, it turns out died just three weeks after being redeemed. Christmas Present is hiding a fear, that he isn't really changed. While leading Clint thru the spirits, Christmas Present falls for a Clint employee, a truly wonderful women, Kimberly, who hates the she has become helping Clint get rich and climbing the corporate ladder. She hits all time low by doing opposition research on a child to help Clint's niece win class President.The series of events past, present and future unfold for Clint, interrupted by Clint avoidance, and CPs self-awareness. All this filled with song and dance as back stage heaven actors make the flash backs work. Not unexpectedly people do change. CP decides to try retirement. CP doesn't think he has changed, not really, but he has a friend now in CP. There is great songs, great fun, a nice twist on human doubt and failure and the idea that redemption doesn't happen over night. It's a tear jerker, yes a dieing sister, but lots of human weakness and a slam at HR. ",comedy

The two, who have been changed into a nice dress by a witch, run over a man in a pumpkin carriage on the way to the ball. Fearing that they would find out, they managed to hide the corpse and safely arrived at the ball at the castle, where Cinderella fell in love with the prince. Meanwhile, the ball is interrupted by the discovery of a man's corpse. Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella face the biggest pinch. A pretty little girl had been gifted a red velvet hood by her loving grandmother. As the girl wore this hood at all times during all of her adventures, she came to be known as Little Red Riding Hood (Kanna Hashimoto). The girl gradually grew up to be a very intelligent woman. On this particular day, Red Riding Hood is traveling through a forest when she is suddenly stopped by a witch named Barbara (Kimura Midoriko). Despite trying to avoid Barbara by all means, the witch is hell-bent on giving her a pair of new magical shoes. But Barbara's magic is self-admittedly bad with shoes, and so she ruins Red Riding Hood's shoes in the process. As the girl washes them at a nearby stream, the boots get carried away by the water, and she has to chase them.When Red Riding Hood finally tracks down her boots, a different woman is wearing them, but she also readily returns them to her. This woman, in shabby clothes and injured bare feet, introduces herself as Cinderella (YÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â»ko Araki). Through her exceptional skills of observation, Red Riding Hood realizes that Cinderella is bullied by her stepmother and stepsisters, who always treat her as their maid. Her stepsisters Anne and Margot were preparing to attend the prince's ball that night, where the prince is supposed to choose his bride. The stepmother hires the best hairdresser for Anne. Cinderella was in the jungle because Margot killed her beloved pigeon and Cinderella was burying it.Cinderella wants to go to the ball as she has heard that the prince is a nice person, who doesn't care about looks. Cinderella says that Margot threw away her shoes. She got cuts in her feet when picking Raspberries, as the bushes had thorns.Soon, Barbara appears once more, and this time, she uses her magic to turn the two young women's clothes into very fancy and rich attire. The witch's niece, Tekla (Kiritani Mirei), also a witch, arrives next, and she gives the women a pair of exquisite glass slippers each, with the warning that the magic will wear off in 24 hours. Now dressed as noblewomen of very high family and culture, Cinderella and Red Riding Hood travel towards the king's castle.The witches further help them by transforming a pumpkin into a carriage and a rat into their coachman, Paul (Muro Tsuyoshi). As this carriage travels through the forest roads towards the hill, something seems to jump right in front of them and is hit by the vehicle. Paul realizes that the carriage has hit and run over a man, who has died from the grave injury. Cinderella immediately recognizes the dead man as Hans (Kaji Masaki), the renowned hairdresser of the king, who could transform anyone into an image of perfect beauty and charm. It is once again Red Riding Hood's detective skills that reveal that this death is more mysterious than it seems, for Hans had not died from the coach accident but had already been dead from a heavy injury at the back of his head.Hans' body is hidden by the road with leaves, and the coach arrives at the castle. An ugly woman, covered in rags is not allowed to enter the ballroom. Red Riding Hood and Cinderella reach the ball and also see the latter's stepmother and the elder stepsister, Anne. The younger sister, Margot, is missing, though, and even her sibling and mother are confused about where she is. It is also noticed that Anne has gotten her long hair cut short by Hans, who had told her that the prince was fond of women with shorter hair.Soon, the king of the land, Bovell (Sato Jiro), and his son, Prince Gilbert (Iwata Takanori), reach the hall, and the party begins. As the prince is choosing women he likes for a dance, all the young ladies gathered try to impress the man. But it is Cinderella who immediately grabs Gilbert's attention, and the two start to dance together. Red notices that someone else at the ball is also wearing glass slippers.However, this merry-making is cut short when a guard of the king's army reaches the place and informs everyone about the mysterious death of Hans. Since the man's body had been found on the way to the castle, it is deemed that the killer must be at the hall, and so everyone's carriages are checked. Since Paul had already cleaned the women's coach earlier, no blood is found on it. But pieces of cheese were found around Hans's body. The woman in rags sneaks into the castle.The guards go to investigate at Hans' house. A bloodied whetstone had been found lying at the place, which meant that the murder had taken place at the hairdresser's house between 1 and 3 pm that afternoon, and this was the murder weapon. Along with this, a number of beautiful locks of hair with decorative ribbons on them had also been found, suggesting that someone who had gone for a haircut must have killed the hairdresser. A woman with shot hair must be the killer.Cinderella notices Anne's ribbon among the ones found at Hans's house. She says Anne was always proud of her beautiful hair.Gradually, as Red Riding Hood starts to investigate the matter and other witnesses are spoken to, more revelations are made. Anne reveals that she went to Hans to get her haircut at 10 AM but didn't want her hair short as she loved them long and flowing. Hans cut her hair forcefully. She also adds that she had entered the castle at 1 PM to meet the prince and she overheard a conversation in his chambers.A secret that had existed between Hans and Prince Gilbert. A year before the present time, the prince had fallen madly in love with a maid of the castle named Remi (Yamamoto Mizuki). The woman also loved the prince, and they intended to marry each other. Gilbert knew that his father would object to the matter because of the difference in their social class, but he was sure that he could convince the king. However, Remi suddenly disappeared one day, never to be seen again. Gilbert believed that his father, King Bovell, must have done something to his lover, and out of anger, he secretly threw the royal crown into the trash. Bovell says that he had nothing to do with Remi's disappearance.The sly hairdresser, Hans, had found out about this incident and held this information against Prince Gilbert as a means of blackmail. The hairdresser also had his own secret, for despite being extremely skilled at his job, he was tremendously jealous of any woman with long, beautiful natural hair that he had not dressed for them. As a sort of twisted revenge, he would cut off the hair of these women and store them at his house. On the day of the ball, Prince Gilbert had found out about this when Hans came to meet him in the afternoon, but he could not do anything about it since the hairdresser threatened to reveal his secret too.Instead, Hans blackmailed the prince into giving him an expensive mirror, which was a family heirloom. Although Gilbert initially agreed, he later decided not to cowardly carry forward this corrupt relationship and thought that he would confess about his crime to the king that night. When Hans' messenger came to the castle later to collect the mirror, Gilbert turned him away. But because of this secret between the two men, Prince Gilbert is arrested on suspicion of murder. He was not in his room for the dance rehearsal. His claim that he had been on a stroll through the forest is not taken seriously by the king. However, Red Riding Hood finds a piece of thorn that had fallen from Gilbert's clothes and proves that he must have taken the stroll since thorn bushes grew on that particular path. A woman in poor, shabby clothes also sneaks into the ballroom and provides an alibi for the prince. She says that she saw the prince on a hilltop between 1 and 3 PM that day. Although this woman's face is hidden, her words are considered, and Prince Gilbert is released.As it is the stroke of midnight, Red and Cinderella make a hasty exit from the ball before the magic wears off, and Cinderella leaving one of her glass slippers behind in her rush.Red stays with Cinderella in her room. Red cannot sleep and goes into the forest.Red Riding Hood makes some more progress when she finds Cinderella's younger step-sister, Margot (Wakatsuki Yumi), hiding in the forest. Along with the others in her family, Margot was also extremely cruel and harsh to Cinderella, as she had apparently thrown away her shoes and then told her to go fetch raspberries for her. This, according to Cinderella, was the reason why she was barefoot and had scratches all over her feet at the beginning.Now, when Red Riding Hood meets Margot and talks to her, she learns that the latter had received a letter from Hans that afternoon, asking her to go to his house so that he could style his hair. However, when Margot reached the place, she was hit by someone from behind, and the woman fainted from the blow. Margot was regaining consciousness when she was hit again.When she woke up, though, Margot found the bloodied whetstone in her hand and the dead body of Hans lying in front of her. She believed that she must have somehow committed the murder as revenge for Hans having cut Anne's beautiful hair short, as she saw Anne's hair on Hans's desk.It was then that Margot made a plan to dispose of the dead body in a way that would make it seem like the man had died in an accident. She took Hans' body to the forest and then waited for a carriage to pass by on the road. As soon as she saw Cinderella and Red Riding Hood's magical carriage, she threw the body in front of it and then hid herself in the forest. The guards find Margot and Red. Red sees a piece of glass fall from Margot's dress. Although Red Riding Hood allows the guards to arrest Margot for being a bully, she also admits that the woman is not the real killer.Red Riding Hood reveals that it was actually her friend, Cinderella, who had actually committed the murder and hidden her act. On the afternoon of the ball, Cinderella had been wishing she could get beautiful by some means when Hans walked into the scene and offered to dress her hair and make her pretty. As Cinderella herself said, this fantasy world was obsessed with physical appearance and beauty, making it an almost necessary attribute. Like everyone else, though, Cinderella had also become obsessed with this same perception of beauty and agreed to Hans' offer.When the two went over to the hairdresser's house, Hans tried to cut off Cinderella's hair without her consent, out of his jealousy. The woman realized this in time, and in order to save her hair, she struck the man down with his whetstone and killed him. She then made the plan of inviting Margot to the place, knocking her unconscious, and fleeing the scene so that whoever would come to the house next would believe that Margot had committed the murder. This would have been the case, too, if Hans' messenger had come to the place, but since Prince Gilbert had turned him down, Margot had all the time to carry out her different plan in order to save herself.That afternoon, even before she had been approached by Hans, Cinderella had met with Tekla and got herself a pair of magical glass slippers. When she killed Hans, the woman had been wearing this very pair of shoes. When Margot came over, and Cinderella had to knock her unconscious with the whetstone, she failed to do so with the first blow. Instead, she had to take another hit, with a different weapon, and she used one of her glass slippers to hit her sister. One of the long heels had broken off from the impact, and it is this clue that Red Riding Hood uses to solve the crime. Later on, when Tekla once again sees Cinderella in the forest with Red Riding Hood, the fairy could not recognize her as the same woman she had earlier met since Barbara had already transformed Cinderella's appearance into that of a princess. This meant that Cinderella actually had two pairs of glass slippers, one of which she used to commit the murder, and the other she wore to the ball.Cinderella had buried the broken pair in the grave of her pigeon. When Red first Cinderella, she was barefoot, because she had buried her broken pair of glass slippers.Cinderella tries to deny the charges at first, but when the first pair of glass slippers transform back into her own shoes after 24 hours, Cinderella confesses to all her crimes. As she is taken away by the guards, the woman asks Prince Gilbert for acceptance, but the man denies giving any consolation to the murderer.With the murder mystery solved, Prince Gilbert now has to choose a bride for himself, and Red Riding Hood solves another puzzle as well. The woman in shabby clothes is none other than the prince's original lover, Remi. One year ago, when the two were deeply in love, Remi had also been invited to Hans' house by the cruel hairdresser, where he tried to cut off her beautiful long hair out of his very same jealousy. Remi somehow managed to escape the disaster, but she was left with a big scar on her cheeks from the scissors. Because of this scar, which made her less beautiful, Remi believed that Prince Gilbert would not accept her, and so she hid herself from him and society.But Remi was still in love with the man, and she always kept a secret watch on him. Now, when Gilbert learns of this entire matter and also meets with Remi, he still confesses his love for her, stating that the scar or anything else would not lessen his feelings for his beloved. Soon, Remi and Gilbert marry with the blessings of King Bovell, and Red Riding Hood also attends the occasion.",comedy

Friday morning  am.An academically focused and passionate football player, Siddharth Babil Khan always wanted every decision he made to be perfect. The stressful decision of applying to the right colleges got to him, and his brother's sudden interest in accompanying him to an early soccer match troubled him even more.Siddharth strongly believed that his brother would only make situations worse for him. After all, it was because of Adi Amrith Jayan that his classmates came up with an embarrassing nickname for him Shitty Siddy, since Sid takes too much time in the bathroom. Siddharth also knew that Adi had a hidden motive behind his sudden interest in watching his elder brother play. Siddharth had always watched the matches from the bench, and his brother coming to support him would be humiliating.nSiddharth tried to explain his situation to his mother, but it did not help his cause. Siddharth had his eyes on his mother's Juhi Chawla car, and now that he had a driving license, he wanted to take it out for a ride. Siddharth's mother categorically asked him not to touch the car while she was away on her business trip. They agreed to go on a weekend family trip together, during which Sid would finally get the chance to drive the car.Adi always wanted to become cool and popular in school, and he was desperately trying to find a way to get into the good books of the football players and the famous senior girls. While Sid did not approve of Adi's desperate behavior, he did take into consideration Adi's opinion about asking Natasha Sabharwal Medha Rana for prom. Sid had a major crush on Natasha for years, but he never dared to express his feelings. She was the popular girl in school, while he was the nerd.Sid was asked to wait on the bench before the match began. He was pretty much lost in his own romantic thoughts when Own Goal the nickname of the player injured his leg and was pulled out of the match. The coach asked Sid to join, and his only advice for Sid was to pass the ball to the star football player, Kabir Aditya Jain. After waiting on the bench for years, Sid finally got the chance to prove himself as a footballer. When the ball was passed to him, he could either attempt to score the goal or lose the opportunity while trying to pass it to Kabir. Sid took his chance and scored. Natasha and her sister Nitya were also at the game.nWhile the players and students celebrated the win, Sid left the field. But as soon as he left the restroom, he found 'fans' swarming all around him.nSid learns that Kabir is also looking to ask Natasha for the prom.Sid meets the school's counselor, who begs him to start his university application process, which he has been stalling for  months. Sid says that if he has to take a gap year, so be it, but he won't apply without doing proper research.To celebrate the grand win, the football team declared a Friday night party, popularly known as the FNP Friday Night Plan. Sid initially decided not to attend the party, but his decision changed when Natasha asked him to join. Natasha wanted to go on a latenight car ride, and Sid jumped at the opportunity, promising to bring his car to the party. Natasha says that the boys are meeting at JC's before the party and says that Kabir will text him the details.nAdi was over the moon once he realized that Sid would be attending the party. Sid could not leave Adi alone at home since their mother was away, so unwillingly, he had to take Adi along.Adi helped Sid prepare for the party by introducing him to all the party games and helping him dress right for the occasion. Sid felt extremely guilty driving his mother's car, but he had no other option. He had to prove to Natasha that he was worth going to prom with, and a latenight drive could be a way to her heart. Sid and Adi met with the rest of the football team at a shady eatery. The boys from the opposing school paid the owner of the eatery to turn on the sprinklers, leaving the ISM boys soaking wet.The prank was almost a ritual that both schools engaged in, and it was time for ISM to come up with an equally embarrassing prank idea. Adi stepped in and suggested they throw eggs at the opposing players. Sid was behind the wheel while the rest of the boys attacked the Global School boys with eggs. Unfortunately, instead of hitting a player, one of the eggs Adi threw landed on a police officer. As apologetic as Sid was about the incident, he could not afford to stay back and sort out the matter. The car belonged to his mother, and he could not land in trouble. But the police officer was not ready to let go of them. His ego was hurt, and he decided to teach the boys a lesson. He followed the car, and once Sid and Adi left it parked on the side of the road, he towed it after he found eggs inside the car. Sid and Adi ask Kabir to come pick them up for the party.After reaching the party, Sid decided to go back to the location where he left the car with Kabir's car and his driver. As soon as he reached it, he realized that the car had been towed. Sid called Adi for support, but as usual, his younger brother was not worried at all. Adi's logic was simple since they could not deal with the car issue, it was better to party. He advised Sid to inform their mother the next morning and leave it to her to deal with the police. Sid was guilttripping, and after disconnecting Adi's call, he dialed his mother's number. He had broken her trust, and he sought comfort in her voice. Meanwhile, Adi continued to portray his brother as an actionhero figure who not only scored a goal in the morning but was also a smooth driver who maneuvered through the Mumbai alleys and helped them complete the prank.Unable to make a decision, Sid arrived at the party. He confronted Adi and accused him of being a coward who always created trouble but did not have the guts to face any consequences. Adi tried to stay calm, but he was not ready to accept all the accusations. He retorted and accused Sid of being timid and always hiding behind his problems.nSid enjoyed dancing, but he never dared to shake a leg in public. Adi reminded Sid how he had failed to send a single college application simply because he lacked clarity. He was so hesitant about making the wrong decision that he chose not to even try.Adi believed that Sid changed after the death of their father. He wanted to become responsible and dependable, but in the process, he forgot to enjoy his life in the first place. Sid agreed that he could not bear the thought of disappointing their mother, and he challenged Adi to call their mother and confess the truth. Adi pretended to call her and convinced Sid that their mother was busy, and she said that she would take care of the mess after she returned home.nSid was relieved, and he finally decided to enjoy the night. Adi did what he thought was best for his brother. He knew that they would not be able to solve the problem that night, but Sid could have the most memorable night and enjoy his last few days in school.Everyone at the party welcomed Sid with open arms. He was having the time of his life, playing party games and dancing with his crush. Adi's best friend, Nitya Aadhya Anand, had overheard Sid and Adi's argument, and later, when Sid came up to her to talk, she explained how Adi had no illintentions for him. Sid realized he might have been too harsh on Adi, and they made up, singing and dancing to a song that they had composed. But Sid did not know then that Adi had called their mother in the meantime. Adi was feeling guilty after his confrontation with Sid. He wondered if he truly was a disappointment to their mother, and he called her for comfort. After receiving calls from both her sons, she figured out that something was going on. Her meeting had ended, and she decided to return home.Before Sid learned about the truth, he got a chance to spend some time alone with Natasha. He expressed how well he related to the poetry she had penned for English class, and Natasha explained that it was her sister, Nitya, who had composed it. Sid realized that he barely knew Natasha, and the bit he fell in love with was not really her. While Natasha showed interest in him, Sid made it clear that he did not wish to pursue a relationship that he did not see any potential in. After his honest conversation with Natasha, Sid apologized to Adi. As soon as the brothers united, Adi confessed that their mother was on her way back home.The plan was to somehow convince the police officer to allow them to take their car home. After reaching the police station, Sid begged the subinspector, Suhas Pingale Ninad Kamat, to forgive their childish mistake, and he was about to offer him money when Adi came to his rescue. Adi realized that the subinspector would be offended if he was offered money, and so he interrupted Sid and confessed that he was the one who flung an egg at him. After apologizing and appreciating the policeman for being an honest cop, Suhas Pingale allowed them to leave the station with their car.The brothers drove back home, and before their mother arrived, they managed to sort everything out on their own. As soon as their mother entered the house, she asked them to explain the phone calls, and the brothers decided to confess the truth. After overcoming what seemed impossibly stressful, they realized they could laugh about it with their mother.nThe two brothers became closer than ever before. Not only that, Sid realized that he barely knew the girl he had a crush on and could instead relate more to her sister, Nitya.nSid was the famous kid in school with a prom date and a newfound confidence to take the risk and apply to colleges.",comedy

While escaping her home from armed conflict, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplet infant children Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. The candle Alma carries with her becomes magical and creates a sentient house, the ""Casita"", for the Madrigals to live in. Years later a village grows, protected by the Casita, and members of the Madrigal family are gifted superhuman abilities they use to help the villagers (""The Family Madrigal""). However, Bruno's gift of precognition causes multiple conflicts that lead to the family vilifying him, while Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, is treated differently for having no gift at all.During the evening of Pepa\'s youngest son Antonio being gifted with the ability to speak to animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita is found seemingly fine (""Waiting On A Miracle""). Mirabel, resolving to save the magic of the Casita, goes around to investigate and question her family members. Her older sister Luisa - who possesses superhuman strength - suggests that Bruno's room may hold some clues to the phenomenon (""Surface Pressure""). There, Mirabel sees a cave of sand and pieces of a slab of opaque jade glass, which - when repaired - constitute an image supposedly showing her causing the Casita to fall apart.

Mirabel convinces him to make predictions again and gets Antonio's permission to use the latter's room. Bruno makes another vision, which shows the Casita collapsing and an image of Mirabel embracing Isabela.Mirabel goes to apologize but instead learns of Isabela\'s burden of being perfect and her desire not to marry Mariano. Having poured out her feelings, Isabela's powers start to develop and both sisters reconcile (""What Else Can I Do?"").

tt8946378,"A detective investigates the death of the patriarch of an eccentric, combative family.
When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's disfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death. Nothing could blemish the lavish birthday party at the palatial estate of acclaimed crime/mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey except for his strange and unaccountable death. Now, the sharp knife in the silver-haired deceased's hand is a dead giveaway that something, or someone, had been bothering Harlan. But cryptic detective Benoit Blanc is not entirely sure. Because, as it turns out, there are more than a few members of the successful author's clingy family who have been economical with the truth so far. And as Blanc struggles to shed light on a tangled mess of half-baked leads and little white lies, all eyes are on the grand prize: Harlan's magnificent legacy. The question is, can Benoit find the answer to this perplexing case before someone else dies? The morning after his eighty-fifth birthday party held at his Norfolk County mansion with his dysfunctional family of his mother, his surviving children, their spouses, and their children in attendance, successful novelist and publishing house owner Harlan Thrombey, self-made in his wealth, is discovered in his attic study by Fran, one of the housekeepers, him dead with his throat slashed, knife in hand. Arguably the last person to see him alive was his Brazilian nurse, Marta Cabrera, the daughter of an illegal immigrant, something she has told few within this sphere. She went through her evening ritual of playing a game of Go with him and administering his medication at that time. A week later following the funeral, the local police are questioning the family members at the mansion to see what happened that night that could have led to his death, the questioning in their belief that Harlan committed suicide. The interviewees all confirm the time-line of events supporting that suicide belief. One other person at each of the interviews is famed private detective Benoit Blanc, who the family will learn has been retained as a consultant. What he fails to tell them in return is that he was hired anonymously, cash in advance. Blanc is able to bait many of the interviewees into bad mouthing other family members while being reticent to admit something that Blanc already seems to know about them, each of the family members looking out solely for him/herself. The key interview, one that happens unexpectedly, may be with Marta, who Blanc suspects was Harlan's confidante and who cannot lie in always having the physical reaction of vomiting whenever she does. One person not interviewed in being absent is one of Harlan's grandchildren, overly privileged Ransom Drysdale, who left the party early after having had a private conversation with his grandfather, he not being interviewed somewhat immaterial as Ransom was known to have not been at the mansion at the time of death. The nature of the investigation changes a week later at the reading of the will, where all will discover but some who were already aware that Harlan had rewritten it the week before his death, the specific changes not known until this day. With all these comings and goings, learning the full truth of what happened with Harlan may come down to discovering the unknown of who hired Blanc and why.",comedy

After his wife's death, Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) decided to hide from the world with his beloved animals. But he has to take a journey to a mysterious island to find a healing tree, which is the only medicine that can help the dying Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) in Buckingham Palace. After his wife's death, the eccentric, famed doctor and veterinarian of Victorian England, John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) isolates himself away behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor with his animals for company. When Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) falls ill, a reluctant Dolittle is forced to go on an epic adventure to a mythical island in search of a cure, regaining his wit and courage as he crosses old adversaries and encounters wondrous creatures.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Santhosh. The film starts with a storybook-like depiction of the life of 19th Century British veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.), as told by Poly the parrot (voice of Emma Thompson). He has the ability to communicate with animals, and he would travel the world with his beloved wife Lily (Kasia Smutniak), finding other scared or hurt animals and bringing them to their sanctuary. One day, Lily went sailing on a voyage with Poly, but she was caught in a terrible storm where she perished. Poly brought Dolittle her ring back, and he became so distraught that he closed up the sanctuary, shutting himself away from contact with other people.Years later, a boy named Tommy Stubbins (Harry Collett) is hunting with his uncle and cousin. He is too nervous to hit a bird, and he accidentally shoots a squirrel named Kevin (voice of Craig Robinson). Stubbins' uncle gives him a knife to put the squirrel out of his misery, but Stubbins instead takes it with him. Poly spots the boy and tells him to follow her, where she leads him to Dolittle's sanctuary. Stubbins is startled by Yoshi the polar bear (voice of John Cena), leading him to stumble into a trap. He is found by a girl called Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado), who was sent by Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) on an urgent matter.Inside the sanctuary, Dolittle is playing chess with several mice against Chee-Chee, (voice of Rami Malek) a cowardly gorilla, joined by Dab-Dab, (Octavia Spencer), a scatterbrained duck, and Jip, (voice of Tom Holland) a bespectacled dog. After learning that there are other humans outside, Dolittle sends Chee-Chee to answer the door. He and Stubbins freak each other out. Stubbins brings Kevin to Dolittle for help, while Lady Rose tells Dolittle that Queen Victoria has summoned him to Buckingham Palace. Dolittle helps Kevin recover but has no desire to leave his home. After much goading from Poly, Dolittle relents, tidies himself up, and heads out.Dolittle rides to Buckingham Palace using Plimpton (voice of Kumail Nanjiani), a neurotic ostrich, while Poly, Yoshi, Kevin, Jip, and Dab-Dab join. Upon arriving, he finds his former medical school rival, Dr. Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen), there to check on the queen, brought up by Lord Badgley (Jim Broadbent). Dolittle and his animals enter the Queen's room, where he talks to her pet squid and learns that she was poisoned with deadly nightshade. The only cure is the Eden Fruit, which is on a far away island. Dolittle takes it upon himself to seek the tree out and bring back the fruit to save the Queen before an eclipse occurs, at which point she will perish. Although Stubbins wants to join Dolittle and be his apprentice after being amazed by the animals, Dolittle simply sends him back home.The next morning, Betsy the giraffe (voice of Selena Gomez) and Tutu the fox (voice of Marion Cotillard) join Poly in helping Stubbins escape his home and join Dolittle on his voyage. However, once they get to the docks, the ship has already departed. They spot a bridge, so Betsy rides with Stubbins until they manage to make it there and have him jump safely onto the ship.While on their journey, Stubbins takes time to learn the language of the other animals, which impresses Dolittle. Soon, Mudfly and his cronies sail nearby in their own ship and begin to catch up. Dolittle and Yoshi go underwater to get a whale to help pull them faster to the island. Dolittle's rope starts to break, so Stubbins tries to pull it back with Yoshi's help, but Chee-Chee freezes up when he has a chance to help pull. Dolittle does manage to get himself back onto the ship, but Chee-Chee is ashamed at himself for failing to help.Since their map doesn't have the exact location of the Eden Tree, the crew must stop at an island of bandits, run by King Rassouli (Antonio Banderas), who was also Lily's father. He is in possession of Lily's journal, which has the tree's location. Knowing that Rassouli would NOT be happy to see him, he and Stubbins attempt to disguise themselves. They are led by a dragonfly named James (voice of Jason Mantzoukas) to Rassouli's room where Stubbins tries to sneak in and find the journal while trying not to wake up Rassouli or his pet lionesses. The boy gets close, but Rassouli spots him and captures him, along with Dolittle.Rassouli throws Dolittle into a den where he must deal with a gold-fanged tiger named Barry (voice of Ralph Fiennes), who has serious mommy issues and has a bone to pick with Dolittle for not helping him get over this, while Stubbins is taken by the other bandits. Although Dolittle tries again, Barry is set on eating him. The other animals show up to help after Stubbins has James send them a message, with Yoshi blowing up the bandits' hideout, while Chee-Chee breaks into the cage and musters up the nerve to fight Barry. They help Dolittle get out as Stubbins has gotten the journal, but they are stopped by Mudfly and his soldiers, where the villain admits to having the Queen poisoned so that he can go find the cure and bask in all the rewards. They take the journal and destroy Dolittle's ship.As things are looking down, Yoshi and Plimpton bond over having negligent fathers. Dolittle expresses his disappointment in himself, which Rassouli overhears. Although he dislikes Dolittle for taking Lily away, he knows she would have wanted him to continue his quest. He gives him an old ship to allow him to return to the sea. Dolittle uses the help of whales to track down Mudfly's ship.The crew reaches the island but spot Mudfly's men already making their way inside. They climb up another way to get past the villains and eventually come across the tree and the fruit, but Mudfly and his men get there as well. Soon, they are confronted by a large dragon (Frances De La Tour), who begins to attack the soldiers. Dolittle saves Mudfly from getting killed, which leads to him having an epiphany about being a better person, only to push another soldier in the dragon's path before falling down a hole. After scaring away the other soldiers, the dragon sets her sights on Dolittle and his friends, but he then spots another dragon skeleton, which makes him realize she has lost her beloved, and so he sympathizes with her. He also notes that she is backed up internally, so he proceeds to give her an enema so that she may expel all the armor and weaponry that she has devoured over the years. She thanks Dolittle and allows him to take the fruit.With the Queen mere minutes from death, Dolittle and the animals manage to make it in time. However, Lord Badgley attempts to send the guards after them. The animals hold them off and get the fruit to Stubbins, who uses it to heal the Queen. Dolittle then learns from a stick bug that he left behind that Badgley is the mastermind behind the Queen's poisoning, as he has the vial of nightshade in his pocket. Badgley attempts to escape but is quickly subdued and imprisoned. The Queen thanks Dolittle and Stubbins for saving her.Dolittle returns to his sanctuary where he has officially taken Stubbins on as an apprentice, and he has decided to reopen the sanctuary to the public, as Lily would have wanted.During the closing credits, we see Mudfly still in the cave. He attempts to communicate with bats, only for them to swarm around him menacingly.",comedy

When two drifters travelling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found, the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold.

The other man remains and must endure the harsh desert climate, preying wolves and intruders, whilst battling the creeping doubt that he has been abandoned to his own fate. In the not too distant future, two drifters (Zac Efron, Anthony Hayes) traveling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found and the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary tools. The other man remains and must endure harsh desert elements, ravenous wild dogs, and mysterious intruders, while battling the sinking suspicion that he has been abandoned to his own fate. The film sets its place of unfolding at first, with grainy, dusty desert landscapes with barren trees, and a text on the screen calls it ""some time, someplace, not far from now."" An unnamed man, played by Zac Efron (and therefore will be referred to by the actor's name as the characters in the film remain unnamed), is seen traveling in a goods train compartment, eating away a piece of bread. At the other end of the compartment is a woman and her baby, both hungrily looking at the food. This seems to warm Efron's heart, and he offers the rest of the bread to her before getting down at his station. The place is a run-down outpost but seemingly serves as a connection point to an area called The Compound, where Efron's character plans to go. He asks around for a man who is supposed to drive him to the place, but the attendant at the outpost is as inhospitable as the barren desert all around. As he relieves himself in a dirty makeshift washroom, the second man, played by Anthony Hayes, arrives at the place. The two quickly set out on their journey towards The Compound, and the Hayes character seems to be opportunistic from the very beginning, as he charges extra money from the other man for gas and water.
